3D Spatial Layouts Using A-Teams Spatial layout is the problem of arranging a set of components in an enclosure such that a set of objectives and constraints is satisfied. The constraints may include non-interference of objects, accessibility requirements and connection cost limits. Spatial layout problems are found primarily in the domains of electrical engineering and mechanical engineering in the design of integrated circuits and mechanical or electromechanical artifacts. Traditional approaches include ad-hoc (or specialized) heuristics, Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. The A-Teams approach provides a way of synergistically combining these approaches in a modular agent based fashion. A-Teams are also open to the addition of new agents. Modifications in the task requirements translate to modifications in the agent mix. In this paper we describe how modular A-Team based optimization can be used to solve 3 dimensional spatial layout problems.
