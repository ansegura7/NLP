AdaBoost for Query-by-Example in Text This paper describes an implementation of query-by-example, or relevance  feedback, for text. The implementation uses Google's search engine  to perform a keyword query as requested by the user. If the user  requires more information, the user may score documents in the result  set as relevant or irrelevant. An implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm  is then used choose words that separate the relevant documents  from a random document set. Examples of negative document sets are  also tested. An example query and refinements of the query is presented.  The results seem promising. The system seems to propose new keywords  that are sensible to the requested context. Many of the keywords prove  useful in constructing new queries. However, refinement using exactly  the new terms predicted by the system does not seem to return noticeably  better or worse results. This may be the result of an inexact fit  between the design of AdaBoost and the capabilities of Google as a back  end engine. ...
