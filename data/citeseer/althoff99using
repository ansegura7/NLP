Using Case-Based Reasoning for Supporting Continuous Improvement Processes The goal of the IPQM project -- a collaboration of the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA) in Stuttgart and the Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering (IESE) in  Kaiserslautern -- is to develop a technical infrastructure to support continuous improvement processes. We  describe the approach we took in some detail and focus on the implementation of the IPQM system and its currently ongoing evaluation in the healthcare sector. We also give an outlook on intended extensions of the  system and its application in other domains.
