The Power of Word Clusters for Text Classification The recently introduced Information Bottleneck method [21] provides an information theoretic framework, for extracting features of one variable, that are relevant for the values of another variable. Several previous works already suggested applying this method for document clustering, gene expression data analysis, spectral analysis and more. In this work we present a novel implementation of this method for supervised text classification. Specifically, we apply the information bottleneck method to find word-clusters that preserve the information about document categories and use these clusters as features for classification. Previous work [1] used a similar clustering procedure to show that word-clusters can significantly reduce the feature space dimensionality, with only a minor change in classification accuracy. In this work we present similar results and go further to show that when the training sample is small word clusters can yield significant improvement in classification accuracy (up to ??????????) over the performance using the words directly. 1
