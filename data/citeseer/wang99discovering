Discovering Structural Association of Semistructured Data Many semistructured objects are similarly, though not identically, structured. We study the  problem of discovering "typical" substructures of a collection of semistructured objects. The  discovered structures can serve the following purposes: (a) the "table-of-contents" for gaining  general information of a source, (b) a road map for browsing and querying information sources,  (c) a basis for clustering documents, (d) partial schemas for providing standard database access  methods, (e) user/customer's interests and browsing patterns. The discovery task is impacted  by structural features of semistructured data in a non-trivial way and traditional data mining  frameworks are inapplicable. We define this discovery problem and propose a solution.  1 Introduction  1.1 Motivation  Many on-line documents, such as HTML, Latex, BibTex, SGML files and those found in digital libraries, are semistructured. Semistructured data arises when the source does not impose a rigid structure (such as the ...
