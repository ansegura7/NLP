DyDa: Dynamic Data Warehouse Maintenance in a Fully Concurrent Environment Data warehouse is an emerging technology to support high-level decision making by gathering data from several distributed information sources into one repository. In dynamic environments, data warehouses must be maintained in order to stay consistent with the underlying sources. Recently proposed view maintenance algorithms tackle the problem of data warehouse maintenance under concurrent source data updates.While the view synchronization is to handle non-concurrent source schema changes. However, the concurrency between interleaved schema changes and data updates still remain unexplored problems.  In this paper, we propose a solution framework called DyDa that successfully addresses this problem. The DyDa framework detects concurrent schema changes by a broken query scheme and conicting concurrent data updates by a local timestamp scheme. A fundamental idea of the DyDa framework is the development of a two-layered architecture that separates the concerns for concurrent data updates and concurrent schema changes handling without imposing any restrictions on the sourse update transactions. At the lower level of the framework, it employs a local compensation algorithm to handle concurrent data updates, and a metadata name mapping strategy to handle concurrent source rename operations. At the higher level, it addresses the problem of concurrent source drop operations. For the latter problem, we design a strategy for the detection and correction of such concurrency and nd an executable plan for the aected updates. We then develop a new view adaption algorithm, called Batch-VA for execution of such plan to incrementally adapt the view. Put together, these algorithms are the rst to provide a complete solution to data warehouse management in a fully concurrent environment....
