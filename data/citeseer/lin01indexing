Indexing and Retrieving Natural Language Using Ternary Expressions Traditional information retrieval systems based on the "bag-of-words" paradigm cannot completely capture the semantic content of documents. Yet it is impossible with current technology to build a practical information access system that fully analyzes and understands unrestricted natural language. However, if we avoid the most complex and processing-intensive natural language understanding techniques, we can construct a large-scale information access system which is capable of processing unrestricted text, largely understanding it, and answering natural language queries with high precision. We believe that ternary expressions are the most suitable representational structure for such a system; they are expressive enough for information retrieval purposes, yet amenable to rapid large-scale indexing.
