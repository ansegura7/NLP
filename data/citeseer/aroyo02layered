A Layered Approach towards Domain Authoring Support This paper presents an approach to authoring support for Web courseware based on a layered  ontological paradigm. The ontology-based layers in the courseware authoring architecture  serve as a basis for formal semantics and reasoning support in performing generic authoring  tasks. This approach represents an extension of our knowledge classification and indexing  mechanism from a previously developed system, AIMS, aimed at supporting students while  completing learning tasks in a Web-based learning/training environment. We propose the addition  of two vertical layers in the system architecture, Author assisting layer and Operational  layer, with the role of facilitating the creation of the ontological layers (Course ontology and  Domain ontology) and of the educational metadata layer. Here we focus on the domain ontology  creation process, together with the support that the additional layers can provide within  this process. We exemplify our method by presenting a set of generic tasks related to conceptbased  domain authoring and their ontological support
