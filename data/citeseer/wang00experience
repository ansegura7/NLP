Experience paper: Implementing a Multi-Agent Architecture for Cooperative Software Engineering The paper describes experiences we have earned from implementing a multiagent architecture used to support cooperative software engineering. Before starting to implement a multi-agent architecture, important decisions and considerations must be taken into account. You have to decide how to provide efficient inter-agent communication support, what language should the agents talk, should the agents be stationary or mobile, and what technology should be used to build the architecture. This paper describes how we implemented our multi-agent system, and the experiences we gained from building it. Keywords: Cooperative Software Engineering, Agents, Multi-agent system, KQML, XML, Aglets, JATLite, CORBA. 1 Introduction The last couple of years, distributed computing and agent technology have become more and more popular. When researchers are developing prototypes, the choice of technologies and how to use different technologies is getting more and more complicated. This paper descri...
