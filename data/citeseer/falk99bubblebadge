The BubbleBadge: A Wearable Public Display We are exploring the design space of wearable computers by designing "public" wearable computer displays. This paper describes our first prototype, the BubbleBadge. By effectively turning the wearer's private display "inside out", the BubbleBadge transforms the wearable computing concept by making digital information public rather than private. User tests showed that the device introduces a new way to interact with information-providing devices, suggesting that it would be valuable to explore the concept further. Keywords Wearable computers, interaction technology, public displays INTRODUCTION A wearable computer is defined as a continuously running, augmenting and mediating computational device [2]. Wearable computers are usually highly private, since both input and output is controlled and seen only by the user, who is effectively "hiding" behind a hand-held keyboard and a head-mounted display. But while wearable computing can be a powerful tool for the single user, there is usuall...
