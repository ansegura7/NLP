Genetic Programming and Multi-Agent Layered Learning by Reinforcements We present an adaptation of the standard genetic program (GP) to hierarchically decomposable, multi-agent learning problems. To break down a problem that requires cooperation of multiple agents, we use the team objective function to derive a simpler, intermediate objective function for pairs of cooperating agents. We apply GP to optimize first for the intermediate, then for the team objective function, using the final population from the earlier GP as the initial seed population for the next. This layered learning approach facilitates the discovery of primitive behaviors that can be reused and adapted towards complex objectives based on a shared team goal.
