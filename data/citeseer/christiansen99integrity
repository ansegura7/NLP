Integrity Constraints and Constraint Logic Programming It is shown that constraint logic is useful for evaluation of integrity constraints in deductive databases. Integrity constraints are represented as calls to a metainterpreter for negation-as-failure implemented as a constraint solver. This procedure, called lazy negationas -failure, yields an incremental evaluation: It starts checking the existing database and each time an update request occurs, simplified constraints are produced for checking the particular update and new constraints corresponding to specialized integrity constraints are generated for the updated database. 1 Introduction  There is a relationship between integrity constraints in databases and the constraints of constraint logic programming going beyond the partial overlap of the names applied for these phenomena. Both concern conditions that should be ensured for systems of interdependent entities: the different tuples in a database, and the set of variables in a program execution state. Both relate to problems that e...
