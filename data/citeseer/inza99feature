Feature Subset Selection by Bayesian networks based optimization In this paper we perform a comparison among FSS-EBNA, a randomized, populationbased  and evolutionary algorithm, and two genetic and other two sequential search approaches  in the well known Feature Subset Selection (FSS) problem. In FSS-EBNA, the  FSS problem, stated as a search problem, uses the EBNA (Estimation of Bayesian Network  Algorithm) search engine, an algorithm within the EDA (Estimation of Distribution  Algorithm) approach. The EDA paradigm is born from the roots of the GA community  in order to explicitly discover the relationships among the features of the problem and not  disrupt them by genetic recombination operators. The EDA paradigm avoids the use of  recombination operators and it guarantees the evolution of the population of solutions and  the discovery of these relationships by the factorization of the probability distribution of  best individuals in each generation of the search. In EBNA, this factorization is carried out  by a Bayesian network induced by a chea...
