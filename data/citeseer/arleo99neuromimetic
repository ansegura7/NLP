Neuro-Mimetic Navigation Systems: A Computational Model of the Rat Hippocampus : We propose a bio-inspired approach to autonomous navigation  based on some of the components that rats use for navigation. A spatial  model of the environment is constructed by unsupervised Hebbian learning.  The representation consists of a population of localized overlapping place  elds, modeling place cell activity in the rat Hippocampus. Place elds  are established by extracting spatio-temporal properties of the environment  from visual sensory inputs. Visual ambiguities are resolved by means of  path integration. Reinforcement learning is applied to use place cell activity  for goal-oriented navigation. Experimental results obtained with a mobile  Khepera robot are presented.  Keywords: Autonomous robots, hippocampus, place elds, unsupervised  learning, reinforcement learning, population vector coding, path integration.  1. Introduction  The complexity of the autonomous navigation task is inherent in the concept of autonomy: Ideally, an autonomous agent should have a completely ...
