Flying Emulator: Rapid Building and Testing of Networked Applications for Mobile Computers This paper presents a mobile-agent framework for building and testing  mobile computing applications. When a portable computing device is moved into  and attached to a new network, the proper functioning of an application running  on the device often depends on the resources and services provided locally in the  current network. To solve this problem, this framework provides an applicationlevel  emulator of portable computing devices. Since the emulator is constructed  as a mobile agent, it can carry target applications across networks on behalf of  a device, and it allows the applications to connect to local servers in its current  network in the same way as if they were moved with and executed on the device  itself. This paper also demonstrates the utility of this framework by describing  the development of typical location-dependent applications in mobile computing  settings.
