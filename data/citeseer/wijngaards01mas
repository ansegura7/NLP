On MAS Scalability In open dynamic multi-agent environments the number of agents can vary significantly within very  short periods of time. Very few (if any) current multi-agent systems have, however, been designed to  cope with large-scale distributed applications. Scalability requires increasing numbers of new agents and  resources to have no noticeable effect on performance nor to increase administrative complexity. In this  paper a number of implications for techniques and management are discussed. Current research on agent  middleware is briefly described.  1
