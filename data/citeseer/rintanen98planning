A Planning Algorithm not based on Directional Search The initiative in STRIPS planning has recently been taken by work on propositional satisfiability. Best current planners, like Graphplan, and earlier planners originating in the partial-order or refinement planning community have proved in many cases to be inferior to general-purpose satisfiability algorithms in solving planning problems. However, no explanation of the success of programs like Walksat or relsat in planning has been offered. In this paper we discuss a simple planning algorithm that reconstructs the planner in the background of the SAT/CSP approach. 1 INTRODUCTION  Many of the recent interesting results in AI planning did not originate in traditional planning research, but in work on algorithms for checking the satisfiability of propositional formulae. STRIPS planning problems have been used as benchmarks to test SAT algorithms based on greedy local search [Kautz and Selman, 1992; Kautz and Selman, 1996] , and new developments [Bayardo, Jr. and Schrag, 1997] of the well-...
