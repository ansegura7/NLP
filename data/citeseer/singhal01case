A Case Study in Web Search using TREC Algorithms Web search engines rank potentially relevant pages/sites for a user query. Ranking documents for user queries has also been at the heart of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC in short) under the label ###### retrieval. The TREC community has developed document ranking algorithms that are known to be the best for searching the document collections used in TREC, which are mainly comprised of newswire text. However, the web search community has developed its own methods to rank web pages/sites, many of which use link structure on the web, and are quite dierentfrom  the algorithms developed at TREC. This study evaluates the performance of a state-of-the-art keyword-based document ranking algorithm (coming out of TREC) on a popular web search task: nding the web page/site of an entity, #### companies, universities, organizations, individuals, etc. This form of querying is quite prevalentonthe web. The results from the TREC algorithms are compared to four commercial web search engines. Results show that for nding the web page/site of an entity, commercial web search engines are notably better than a state-of-the-art TREC algorithm. These results are in sharp contrast to results from several previous studies.  Keywords  Search engines, TREC ad-hoc, keyword-based ranking, linkbased ranking  1.
