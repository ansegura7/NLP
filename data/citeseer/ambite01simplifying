Simplifying Data Access: The Energy Data Collection (EDC) Project The massive amount of statistical and text data available from government agencies has created a set  of daunting challenges to both research and analysis communities. These problems include  heterogeneity, size, distribution, and control of terminology. At the Digital Government Research  Center we are investigating solutions to these key problems. In this paper we focus on  (1) ontological mappings for terminology standardization, (2) data integration across data bases with  high speed query processing, and (3) interfaces for query input and presentation of results. This  collaboration between researchers from Columbia University and the Information Sciences Institute  of the University of Southern California employs technology developed at both locations, in  particular the SENSUS ontology, the SIMS multi-database access planner, the LKB automated  dictionary and terminology analysis system, and others. The pilot application targets gasoline data  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Energy Information Administration of the Department of  Energy, the Census Bureau, and other government agencies.  1
