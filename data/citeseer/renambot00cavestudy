CAVEStudy: an Infrastructure for Computational Steering in Virtual Reality Environments We present the CAVEStudy system that enables scientists to interactively steer a simulation from a virtual reality (VR) environment. No modification to the source code is necessary. CAVEStudy allows interactive and immersive analysis of a simulation running on a remote computer. Using a high-level description of the simulation, the system generates the communication layer (based on CAVERNSoft) needed to control the execution and to gather data at runtime. We describe three case-studies implemented with CAVEStudy: soccer simulation, diode laser simulation, and molecular dynamics.  1. Introduction  High-speed networks and high performance graphics open opportunities for completely new types of applications. As a result, the world of scientific computing is moving away from the batch-oriented management to interactive programs. Also, virtual reality (VR) systems are now commercially available, but so far scientists mainly use them for off-line visualization of data sets produced by a simu...
