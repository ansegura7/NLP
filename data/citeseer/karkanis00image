Image Recognition and Neuronal Networks: Intelligent Systems for the Improvement of Imaging Information this paper we have concentrated on describing issues related to the development and use of artificial neural network-based intelligent systems for medical image interpretation. Research in intelligent systems to-date remains centred on technological issues and is mostly application driven. However, previous research and experience suggests that the successful implementation of computerised systems (e.g., [34] [35]), and decision support systems in particular (e.g., [36]), in the area of healthcare relies on the successful integration of the technology with the organisational and social context within which it is applied. Therefore, the successful implementation of intelligent medical image interpretation systems 9 should not only rely on their technical feasibility and effectiveness but also on organisational and social aspects that may rise from their applications, as clinical information is acquired, processed, used and exchanged between professionals. All these issues are critical in healthcare applications because they ultimately reflect on the quality of care provided.
