Manipulating Interpolated Data is Easier than You Thought Data defined by interpolation is frequently  found in new applications involving geographical  entities, moving objects, or spatiotemporal  data. These data lead to potentially  infinite collections of items, (e.g., the elevation  of any point in a map), whose definitions  are based on the association of a collection of  samples with an interpolation function. The  naive manipulation of the data through direct  access to both the samples and the interpolation  functions leads to cumbersome or inaccurate  queries. It is desirable to hide the  samples and the interpolation functions from  the logical level, while their manipulation is  performed automatically.  We propose to model such data using infinite  relations (e.g., the map with elevation yields  an infinite ternary relation) which can be manipulated  through standard relational query  languages (e.g., SQL), with no mention of the  interpolated definition. The clear separation  between logical and physical levels ensures the  accu...
