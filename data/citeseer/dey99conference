The Conference Assistant: Combining Context-Awareness with Wearable Computing We describe the Conference Assistant, a prototype mobile, context-aware application that assists conference attendees. We discuss the strong relationship between context-awareness and wearable computing and apply this relationship in the Conference Assistant. The application uses a wide variety of context and enhances user interactions with both the environment and other users. We describe how the application is used and the context-aware architecture on which it is based. 1. Introduction  In human-human interaction, a great deal of information is conveyed without explicit communication, but rather by using cues. These shared cues, or context,  help to facilitate grounding between participants in an interaction [3]. We define context to be any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity, where an entity can be a person, place, or physical or computational object.
