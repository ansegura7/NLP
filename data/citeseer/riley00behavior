On Behavior Classification in Adversarial Environments In order for robotic systems to be successful in domains with other agents possibly interfering with the accomplishing of goals, the agents must be able to adapt to the opponents' behavior. The more quickly the agents can respond to a new situation, the better they will perform. We present an approach to doing adaptation which relies on classification of the current adversary into predefined adversary classes. For feature extraction, we present a windowing technique to abstract useful but not overly complicated features. In order to take into account the spatial locality of topological differences, we use a previously developed similarity metric. The feature extraction and classification steps are fully implemented in the domain of simulated robotic soccer, and experimental results are presented.
