Executing Suspended Logic Programs . We present an extension of Logic Programming (LP) which, in addition to ordinary LP clauses, also includes integrity constraints, explicit representation of disjunction in the bodies of clauses and in goals, and suspension of atoms as in concurrent logic languages. The resulting framework aims to unify Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Semantic Query Optimisation (SQO) in deductive databases. We present a proof procedure for the new framework, simplifying and generalising previously proposed proof procedures for ALP. We discuss applications of the framework, formulating traditional problems from LP, ALP, CLP and SQO. Keywords: Logic Programming (LP), Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), Abductive Logic Programming (ALP), Semantic Query Optimisation (SQO) in Deductive Databases.
