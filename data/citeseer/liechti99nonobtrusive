A Non-obtrusive User Interface for Increasing Social Awareness on the World Wide Web Arguing for the need of increasing social awareness on the World Wide Web, we describe a user interface based on the metaphor of windows bridging electronic and physical spaces.

The system takes advantage of the seamless and continuous network connection offered by handheld Web-appliances such as PDA's.
