Context in Web Search Web search engines generally treat search requests  in isolation. The results for a given query  are identical, independent of the user, or the context  in which the user made the request. Nextgeneration  search engines will make increasing  use of context information, either by using explicit  or implicit context information from users, or by  implementing additional functionality within restricted  contexts. Greater use of context in web  search may help increase competition and diversity  on the web.
