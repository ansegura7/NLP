Levels of Control and Closure in Complex Semiotic Systems It is natural to advance closures as "atomic" processes of universal evolution, and to analyze  this concept specifically. While real complex systems like organisms and complex mechanisms  cannot exist at either extreme of complete closure or lack of closure, nevertheless we should  consider the properties of closures in general: the introduction of boundaries; a corresponding  stability; the establishment of system autonomy and identity; and thereby the introduction of  emergent new systems of potentially new types. Our focus should move from simple physical  closure of common objects and classical self-organizing systems to semiotically closed systems  which maintain cyclic relations of perception, interpretation, decision, and action with their  environments. Thus issues arise concerning the use and interpretation of symbols, representations,  and/or internal models (whether explicit or implicit) by the system; and the syntactic,  semantic, and pragmatic relations among the sign tok...
