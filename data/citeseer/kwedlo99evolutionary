An Evolutionary Algorithm Using Multivariate Discretization for Decision Rule Induction We describe EDRL-MD, an evolutionary algorithm-based  system, for learning decision rules from databases. The main novelty of  our approach lies in dealing with continuous - valued attributes. Most of  decision rule learners use univariate discretization methods, which search  for threshold values for one attribute at the same time. In contrast to  them, EDRL-MD simultaneously searches for threshold values for all  continuous-valued attributes, when inducing decision rules. We call this  approach multivariate discretization. Since multivariate discretization is  able to capture interdependencies between attributes it may improve  the accuracy of obtained rules. The evolutionary algorithm uses problem  specific operators and variable-length chromosomes, which allows it to  search for complete rulesets rather than single rules. The preliminary  results of the experiments on some real-life datasets are presented.
