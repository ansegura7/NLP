Learning and Tracking Cyclic Human Motion We present methods for learning and tracking human motion in  video. We estimate a statistical model of typical activities from a  large set of 3D periodic human motion data by segmenting these  data automatically into "cycles". Then the mean and the principal  components of the cycles are computed using a new algorithm  that accounts for missing information and enforces smooth transitions  between cycles. The learned temporal model provides a  prior probability distribution over human motions that can be used  in a Bayesian framework for tracking human subjects in complex  monocular video sequences and recovering their 3D motion.
