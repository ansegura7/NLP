Using Software Agents to Support Evolution of Distributed Workflow Models This paper outlines a high-level design of how software agents can be used combined with an existing CAGIS Process Centred Environment to deal with evolution of distributed, fragmented workflow models. Our process centred environment allows process fragments of the same workflow model to be located in workspaces that are geographically distributed. These process fragments can be changed independently in local workspaces causing consistency problems. We propose to use software mobile agents, offering awareness services solving conflicting updates of process fragment. Our solution is illustrated using some scenarios.  Keywords: Process centred environments, software agents, workflow model consistency, workflow model evolution, distribution, fragmentation.  1 Introduction  Dealing with evolution of workflow processes is not a trivial matter. One simple solution to this problem is to have one centralised workflow model, that cannot be changed after it is instanciated. In practice, it is ho...
