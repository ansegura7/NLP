Using Handheld Devices in Synchronous Collaborative Scenarios . In this paper we present a platform specially designed for groupware  applications running on handheld devices. Common groupware platforms  request desktop computers as underlying hardware platforms. The fundamental  different nature of handheld devices has a great impact on the platform, e.g.  resource limitations have to be considered, the network is slow and unstable.  Often, personal data are stored on handheld devices, thus mechanisms have to  ensure privacy. These considerations lead to the QuickStep platform. Sample  applications developed with QuickStep demonstrate the strengths of the  QuickStep environment.  1 Introduction  Collaborative applications help a group to, e.g., collaboratively create documents, write agendas or schedule appointments. A common taxonomy [3] classifies collaborative applications by time and space, with 'same place' and 'different places' attributes on the space axis and 'same time' (synchronous) and 'different time' (asynchronous) ones on the time ...
