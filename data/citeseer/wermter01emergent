Emergent Neural Computational Architectures based on Neuroscience Present approaches for computing do not have the performance, flexibility and reliability of neural information processing systems. In order to overcome this, conventional computing systems could benefit from various characteristics of the brain such as modular organisation, robustness, timing and synchronisation, and learning and memory storage in the central nervous system. This overview incorporates some of the key research issues in the field of biologically inspired computing systems.
