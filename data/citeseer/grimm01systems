Systems Directions for Pervasive Computing Pervasive computing, with its focus on users and their tasks rather than on computing devices and technology, provides an attractive vision for the future of computing. But, while hardware and networking infrastructure to realize this vision are becoming a reality, precious few applications run in this infrastructure. We believe that this lack of applications stems largely from the fact that it is currently too hard to design, build, and deploy applications in the pervasive computing space. In this paper, we argue that existing approaches to distributed computing are flawed along three axes when applied to pervasive computing; we sketch out alternatives that are better suited for this space. First, application data and functionality need to be kept separate, so that they can evolve gracefully in a global computing infrastructure. Second, applications need to be able to acquire any resource they need at any time, so that they can continuously provide their services in a highly dynamic environment. Third, pervasive computing requires a common system platform, allowing applications to be run across the range of devices and to be automatically distributed and installed. 1.
