For a given query, the usefulness of a search engine in this paper is defined to be a combination of the number of documents in the search engine that are sufficiently similar to the query and the average similarity of these documents. Experimental results indicate that the proposed estimation method is quite accurate. 1 Introduction  Many search engines have been created on the Internet to help ordinary users find desired data. Each search engine has a corresponding database that defines the set of documents that can be searched by the search engine. Usually, an index for all documents in the database is created and stored in the search engine to speed up query processing. The amount of data in the Internet is huge (it is believed that by the end of 1997, there were more than 300 mil...
