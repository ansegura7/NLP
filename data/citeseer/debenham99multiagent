A Multi-Agent System for Emergent Process Management A multi-agent system manages emergent business processes.  The agents in this system all have the same generic  architecture. The generic agent architecture is a three-layer  BDI, hybrid, multi-agent architecture. The architecture copes  with plans whose goals develop and mutate. The agents in the  system choose their course of action on the basis of estimates  of the likelihood of a choice leading to success, and on  estimates of the time, cost and value of making a choice.  1 Introduction  Emergent processes are business processes; they are distinct from production workflows [1]. Emergent processes are opportunistic in nature whereas production workflows are routine. Emergent processes are inherently distributed and involve asynchronous parallel work. What amounts to a "satisfactory conclusion" of an emergent process is not generally known until the process is well advanced. Further, the tasks involved in an emergent process are typically not predefined and emerge as the process deve...
