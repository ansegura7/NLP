Maintaining Horizontally Partitioned Warehouse Views Data warehouses usually store large amounts of information, representing  an integration of base data from different data sources over a long  time period. Aggregate views can be stored as a set of its horizontal fragments  for the purposes of reducing warehouse query response time and  maintenance cost.  This paper proposes a scheme that efficiently maintains horizontally  partitioned data warehouse views. Using the proposed scheme, only one  view fragment holding the relevant subset of tuples of the view is accessed  for each update. The scheme also includes an approach to reduce the  refresh time for maintaining views that compute aggregate functions MIN  and MAX.
