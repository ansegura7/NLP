MobiMine: Monitoring the Stock Market from a PDA This paper describes an experimental mobile data mining system that allows intelligent monitoring of time-critical financial data from a hand-held PDA. It presents the overall system architecture and the philosophy behind the design. It explores one particular aspect of the system-automated construction of personalized focus area that calls for user's attention. This module works using data mining techniques. The paper describes the data mining component of the system that employs a novel Fourier analysis-based approach to efficiently represent, visualize, and communicate decision trees over limited bandwidth wireless networks. The paper also discusses a quadratic programming-based personalization module that runs on the PDAs and the multi-media based user-interfaces. It reports experimental results using an ad hoc peer-to-peer IEEE 802.11 wireless network.
