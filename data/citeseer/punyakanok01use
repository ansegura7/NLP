The Use of Classifiers in Sequential Inference We study the problem of combining the outcomes of several different  classifiers in a way that provides a coherent inference that satisfies some  constraints. In particular, we develop two general approaches for an important  subproblem - identifying phrase structure. The first is a Markovian  approach that extends standard HMMs to allow the use of a rich observation  structure and of general classifiers to model state-observation  dependencies. The second is an extension of constraint satisfaction formalisms.  We develop efficient combination algorithms under both models  and study them experimentally in the context of shallow parsing.  1 Introduction  In many situations it is necessary to make decisions that depend on the outcomes of several different classifiers in a way that provides a coherent inference that satisfies some constraints - the sequential nature of the data or other domain specific constraints. Consider, for example, the problem of chunking natural language sentences ...
