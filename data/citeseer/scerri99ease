The EASE Actor Development Environment In interactive simulations it is often desirable to have intelligent actors  playing the roles of humans. Drawing on a wide range of previous  work this paper presents a system that is intended to reduce some of the  diculties involved in the development of actors. We present a system  called EASE (End-user Actor Specication Environment) that provides  tools and methods to support end user development of intelligent actors.  The tools support the whole development process from design to testing.  The EASE actor architecture is a multi-agent system where a process of  contract making and negotiation between agents determines the actions  of the actor.  1 Introduction  In modern, complex, interactive simulations it is often highly desirable to have intelligent actors playing the roles of humans. The actors' task is dicult { sensing the (simulated) environment, choosing a course of action that exibly and intelligently follows designer intentions and sending appropriate commands back to ...
