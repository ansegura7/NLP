Ontobroker: Or How to Enable Intelligent Access to the WWW . The World Wide Web (WWW) is currently one of the most important  electronic information sources. However, its query interfaces and the provided  reasoning services are rather limited. Ontobroker consists of a number of  languages and tools that enhance query access and inference service in the  WWW. It provides languages to annotate web documents with ontological  information, to represent ontologies, and to formulate queries. The tool set of  Ontobroker allows us to access information and knowledge from the web and to  infer new knowledge with an inference engine based on techniques from logic  programming. This article provides several examples that illustrate these  languages and tools and the kind of service that is provided. We also discuss the  bottlenecks of our approach that stem from the fact that the applicability of  Ontobroker requires two time-consuming activities: (1) developing shared  ontologies that reflect the consensus of a group of web users and (2) annotating  we...
