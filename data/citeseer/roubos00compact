Compact Fuzzy Models Through Complexity Reduction and Evolutionary Optimization Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and other evolutionary optimization  methods to design fuzzy rules from data for systems modeling and  classification have received much attention in recent literature. We show  that different tools for modeling and complexity reduction can be favorably  combined in a scheme with GA-based parameter optimization. Fuzzy clustering,  rule reduction, rule base simplification and constrained genetic optimization  are integrated in a data-driven modeling scheme with low human  intervention. Attractive models with respect to compactness, transparency  and accuracy, are the result of this symbiosis.  I. INTRODUCTION  We focus on learning fuzzy rules from data with low human intervention. Many tools to initialize, tune and manipulate fuzzy models have been developed. We show that different tools can be favorably combined to obtain compact fuzzy rule-based models of low complexity with still good approximation accuracy. A modeling scheme is presented that combine four pr...
