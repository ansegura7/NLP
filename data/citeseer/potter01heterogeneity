Heterogeneity in the Coevolved Behaviors of Mobile Robots: The Emergence of Specialists Many mobile robot tasks can be most efficiently  solved when a group of robots is utilized. The type  of organization, and the level of coordination and  communication within a team of robots affects the  type of tasks that can be solved. This paper examines  the tradeoff of homogeneity versus heterogeneity  in the control systems by allowing a team of  robots to coevolve their high-level controllers given  different levels of difficulty of the task. Our hypothesis  is that simply increasing the difficulty of a task  is not enough to induce a team of robots to create  specialists. The key factor is not difficulty per se,  but the number of skill sets necessary to successfully  solve the task. As the number of skills needed  increases, the more beneficial and necessary heterogeneity  becomes. We demonstrate this in the  task domain of herding, where one or more robots  must herd another robot into a confined space.  1
