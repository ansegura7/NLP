Combinations of Modal Logics  Combining logics for modelling purposes has become a rapidly expanding enterprise that is inspired mainly by concerns about modularity and the wish to join together different kinds of information. As any interesting real world system is a complex, composite entity, decomposing its descriptive requirements (for design, verification, or maintenance purposes) into simpler, more restricted, reasoning tasks is not only appealing but is often the only plausible way forward. It would be an exaggeration to claim that we currently have a thorough understanding of `combined methods.' However, a core body of notions, questions and results has emerged for an important class of combined logics, and we are beginning to understand how this core theory behaves when it is applied outside this particular class.  In this paper we will consider the combination of modal (including temporal) logics, identifying leading edge research that we, and others, have carried out. Such combined sys
