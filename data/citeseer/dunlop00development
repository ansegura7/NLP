Development and Evaluation of Clustering Techniques for Finding People Typically in a large organisation much   expertise and  knowledge  is held informally   within employees' own memories. When  employees leave an organisation many  documented links that go through that person  are broken and no mechanism is usually  available to overcome these broken links. This  matchmaking problem is related to the  problem of finding potential work partners in a  large and distributed organisation. This paper  reports a comparative investigation into using  standard information retrieval techniques to  group employees together based on their web  pages. This information can, hopefully, be  subsequently used to redirect broken links to  people who worked closely with a departed  employee or used to highlight people, say in  different departments, who work on similar  topics. The paper reports the design and  positive results of an experiment conducted at  Ris National Laboratory comparing four  different IR searching and clustering  approaches using real users' we...
