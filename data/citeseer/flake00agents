Agents with Complex Plans: Design and Implementation of CASA We describe the design of CASA, an agent specification language that builds on the formal agent specification approach AgentSpeak (L) and extends it by concepts from concurrent logic programming. With CASA it is possible to design agents with complex behavior patterns like speculative computations and parallel executed strategies. The design of multi agent systems composed of CASA agents is supported by providing predefined message structures and integrating an existing agent communication framework.
