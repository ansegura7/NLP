Effective Site Finding using Link Anchor Information Link-based ranking methods have been described in the literature and applied in commercial Web search engines. However, according to recent TREC experiments, they are no better than traditional content-based methods. We conduct a different type of experiment, in which the task is to find the main entry point of a specific Web site. In our experiments, ranking based on link anchor text is twice as effective as ranking based on document content, even though both methods used the same BM25 formula. We obtained these results using two sets of 100 queries on a 18.5 million docu- ment set and another set of 100 on a 0.4 million document set. This site finding effectiveness begins to explain why many search engines have adopted link methods. It also opens a rich new area for effectiveness improvement, where traditional methods fail.
