Business Process Coordination: State of the Art, Trends, and Open Issues Over the past decade, there has been a lot of  work in developing middleware for integrating  and automating enterprise business processes.  Today, with the growth in e-commerce and the  blurring of enterprise boundaries, there is  renewed interest in business process  coordination, especially for inter-organizational  processes. This paper provides a historical  perspective on technologies for intra- and interenterprise  business processes, reviews the state  of the art, and exposes some open research  issues.
