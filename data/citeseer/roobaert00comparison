Comparison of Learning Approaches to Appearance-based 3D Object Recognition with and without cluttered background We re-evaluate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to appearance-based 3D object recognition, by comparing it to two other learning approaches: the system developed at Columbia University ("Columbia") and a simple image matching system using a nearest neighbor classifier ("NNC").  In a first set of experiments, we compare correct recognition rates of the segmented 3D object images of the COIL database. We show that the performance of the simple "NNC" system compares to the more elaborated "Columbia" and "SVM" systems. Only when the experimental setting is more demanding, i.e. when we reduce the number of views during the training phase, some difference in performance can be observed. In a second set of experiments, we consider the more realistic task of 3D object recognition with cluttered background. Also in this case, we obtain that the performance of the three systems are comparable. Only with the recently proposed black/white background training scheme ("BW") applied t...
