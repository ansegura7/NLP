Putting the Feel in `Look and Feel' Haptic devices are now  commercially available and thus  touch has become a potentially  realistic solution to a variety of  interaction design challenges. We  reportonanexperimental  investigation of the use of touch as  a way of reducing visual overload in  the conventional desktop. In a  two-phase study, we investigated  the use of the PHANToM haptic  device as a means of interacting  with a conventional graphical user  interface. The first experiment  compared the effects of four  different haptic augmentations on  user performance in a simple  targeting task. The second  experiment involved a more  ecologically oriented searching and  scrolling task. Results indicated that  the haptic effects did not improve  users performance in terms of task  completion time. However, the  number of errors made was  significantly reduced. Subjective  workload measures showed that  participants perceived many aspects  of workload as significantly less  with haptics. The results are  described and the implications for  the use of haptics in user interface  design are discussed.
