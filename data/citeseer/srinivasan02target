Target Seeking Crawlers and their Topical Performance Topic driven crawlers can complement search engines by targeting relevant portions of the Web. A topic driven crawler must exploit the information available about the topic and its underlying context. In this paper we extend our previous research on the design and evaluation of topic driven crawlers by comparing seven different crawlers on a harder problem, namely, seeking highly relevant target pages. We find that exploration is an important aspect of a crawling strategy. We also study how the performance of crawler strategies depends on a number of topical characteristics based on notions of topic generality, cohesiveness, and authoritativeness. Our results reveal that topic generality is an obstacle for most crawlers, that three crawlers tend to perform better when the target pages are clustered together, and that two of these also display better performance when topic targets are highly authoritative.
