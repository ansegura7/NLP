dlv { An Overview the Intelligent Grounding, the Model Generator and the Model Checker. All of these modules perform a modular evaluation of their input according to various dependency graphs as de  ned in [5, 2] and try to detect and eciently handle special (syntactic) subclasses, which in general yields a tremendous speedup.    Supported by FWF (Austrian Science Funds) under the project P11580-MAT \A Query System for Disjunctive Deductive Databases"    Please address correspondence to this author.  The Intelligent Grounding takes an input program, whose facts can be stored also in the tables of external relational databases, and eciently generates a subset of the program instantiation that has exactly the same stable models as the full program, but is much smaller in general. (For strati  ed programs, for example, the Grounding already computes the single stable model.)  Then the Model Generator is run on the (ground) output of the Intelligent Grounding. It generates one candidate for a stable model a
