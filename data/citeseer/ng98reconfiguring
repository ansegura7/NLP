On Reconfiguring Query Execution Plans in Distributed Object-Relational DBMS Massive database sizes and growing demands for decision support and data mining result in long-running queries in extensible Object-Relational DBMS, particularly in decision support and data warehousing analysis applications. Parallelization of query evaluation is often required for acceptable performance. Yet queries are frequently processed suboptimally due to (1) only coarse or inaccurate estimates of the query characteristics and database statistics available prior to query evaluation; (2) changes in system configuration and resource availability during query evaluation. In a distributed environment, dynamically reconfiguring query execution plans (QEPs), which adapts QEPs to the environment as well as the query characteristics, is a promising means to significantly improve query evaluation performance. Based on an operator classification, we propose an algorithm to coordinate the steps in a reconfiguration and introduce alternatives for execution context checkpointing and restorin...
