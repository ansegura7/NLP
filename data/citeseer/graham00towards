Towards a Distributed, Environment-Centered Agent Framework . This paper will discuss the internal architecture for an agent framework  called DECAF (Distributed Environment Centered Agent Framework). DECAF  is a software toolkit for the rapid design, development, and execution of  "intelligent" agents to achieve solutions in complex software systems. From a  research community perspective, DECAF provides a modular platform for evaluating  and disseminating results in agent architectures, including communication,  planning, scheduling, execution monitoring, coordination, diagnosis, and  learning. From a user/programmer perspective, DECAF distinguishes itself by  removing the focus from the underlying components of agent building such as  socket creation, message formatting, and agent communication. Instead, users  may quickly prototype agent systems by focusing on the domain-specific parts  of the problem via a graphical plan editor, reusable generic behaviors [9], and  various supporting middle-agents [10]. This paper will briefly describe the...
