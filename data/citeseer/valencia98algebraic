Algebraic Topology for Knowledge Representation in Analogy Solving . We propose a computational model for analogy solving based on a topological formalism of representation. The source and the target analogs are represented as simplexes and the analogy solving is modeled as a topological deformation of these simplexes along a polygonal chain and according to some constraints. We apply this framework to the resolution of IQ-tests typically presented as "given A, B and C, find D such that A is to B what C is to D". 1 Introduction  In this paper, we present a topological framework for knowledge representation based on the concept of simplicial complex. We present then the ESQIMO system which is the application of this framework to an analogy solving problem. The underlying idea developed here is that spatial relationships and more precisely topological relationships such as neighbor, border, dimension, obstruction, deformation, separabitily, path, etc, enable the building and structuration of knowledge representation. More precisely, we explore the possi...
