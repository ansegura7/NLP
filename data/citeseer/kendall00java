A Java Application Framework for Agent Based Systems Agents are the next significant software abstraction, especially for distributed systems. Agent based systems have been developed in response to the following requirements: - Personalized and customized user interfaces that are pro-active in assisting the user - Adaptable, fault tolerant distributed systems that solve complex problems - Open systems where components come and go and new components are continually added. - Migration and load balancing across platforms, throughout a network. - New metaphors, such as negotiation, for solving distributed, multi- disciplinary problems. Agents appear in a wide range of applications, but all agent development to date has been done independently by each development team. This has led to several problems, including i) duplication of effort, ii) inability to satisfy industrial strength requirements for security and scalability, and iii) incompatibility of agent systems. The application framework described in this chapter captures and clarifies th...
