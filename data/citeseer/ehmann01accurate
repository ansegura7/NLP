Accurate and Fast Proximity Queries Between Polyhedra Using Convex Surface Decomposition The need to perform fast and accurate proximity queries arises frequently in physically-based modeling, simulation,  animation, real-time interaction within a virtual environment, and game dynamics. The set of proximity  queries include intersection detection, tolerance verification, exact and approximate minimum distance computation,  and (disjoint) contact determination. Specialized data structures and algorithms have often been designed  to perform each type of query separately. We present a unified approach to perform any of these queries seamlessly  for general, rigid polyhedral objects with boundary representations which are orientable 2-manifolds. The  proposed method involves a hierarchical data structure built upon a surface decomposition of the models. Furthermore,  the incremental query algorithm takes advantage of coherence between successive frames. It has been  applied to complex benchmarks and compares very favorably with earlier algorithms and systems.  1.
