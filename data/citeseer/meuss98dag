DAG Matching Techniques for Information Retrieval on Structured Documents With the establishment of international standards for document representation like SGML, ODA, or XML, attention in Information Retrieval has shifted to representation models and query languages that make active use both of the logical structure and the contents of the documents in a document database. At the same time, representation of structure has become more and more important in other types of databases as well. Among several related approaches, Kilpelainen's Tree Matching is one of the most expressive and intuitive formalisms for querying databases with treestructured entities. However, in its original formulation it leaves aside most of the problems that arise in real-life applications of Information Retrieval. In this paper we extend Tree Matching to DAG Matching and suggest various techniques that should be useful when using the formalism in a practical IR system. In particular we suggest a representation of answers that can cope with the potentially huge number of entities in...
