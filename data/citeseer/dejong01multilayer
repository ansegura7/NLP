Multi-Layer Methods and the Optimal Optimizer Multi-Layer Methods are methods that act on several layers simultaneously. Examples of multi-layer methods are found in multi-agent systems (global and per-agent behavior), in learning (e.g. boosting, bias tuning), in self-adaptive methods (such as evolution strategies), in hybrid approaches, and in optimization (e.g. multiple runs, result pooling). We give a formal definition of what a multi-layer method is. We discuss the relationship with the no free lunch theorem, to show that such a thing as the optimal optimizer exists, and how multi-layer methods can be used to approximate it.
