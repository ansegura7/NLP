Compressive Computation in Analog VLSI Motion Sensors . We introduce several different focal plane analog VLSI motion sensors developed in the past. We show how their pixel-parallel architecture can be used to extract low-dimensional information from a higher dimensional data set. As an example we present an algorithm and corresponding experiments to compute the focus of expansion, focus of contraction and the axis of rotation from natural visual input. A fully integrated system for real-time computation of these quantities is proposed as well. In computer simulations it is shown that the direction of motion vector field is best suited to perform the algorithm even at high noise levels. 1 Analog VLSI Motion Sensors  In the past the computer vision communityhas invested much effort into developing motion detection algorithms; for a critical review see [BFB94]. Implementing these algorithms in real-time systems proved challenging for computational reasons. Additionally it has been realized that a motion vector field is useful mainly as star...
