Highly-Available Firewall Service using Virtual Redirectors This paper introduces the dependable decentralised system architecture developed by the PHDS group. It describes the virtual redirector utilised by this architecture and how a decentralised network layer firewall application is implemented on it. Dependability of the design is achieved through the use of fault-tolerant protocols. The virtual redirector is implemented by a dynamic hashing algorithm, which uses load information and the fault/working status of nodes in the system. The focus of this paper is the implementation of a testbed which is used to compare the performance and availability of the decentralised firewall against a monolithic firewall with equivalent functionality.
