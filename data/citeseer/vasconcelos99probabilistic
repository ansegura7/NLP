Probabilistic Retrieval: New Insights and Experimental Results We present new insights on the relations between a recently introduced probabilistic formulation of the content-based retrieval problem and standard solutions. New experimental results are presented, providing evidence that probabilistic retrieval has superior performance. Finally, a unified representation for texture and color is introduced. 1 Introduction  The problem of retrieving images or video from a database is naturally formulated as a problem of pattern recognition. Given a representation (or feature) space F for the entries in the database, the design of a retrieval system consists of finding a map  g : F ! M = f1; : : : ; Kg  x ! y  from F to the set M of classes identified as useful for the retrieval operation. K, the cardinality of M , can be as large as the number of items in the database (in which case each item is a class by itself), or smaller. If the goal of the retrieval system is to minimize the probability of error, i.e. P (g(x) 6= y), it is well known that the opt...
