The SDCC Framework For Integrating Existing Algorithms for Diverse Data Warehouse Maintenance Tasks Recently proposed view maintenance algorithms tackle the problem of concurrent data updates happening at different autonomous ISs, whereas the EVE system addresses the maintenance of a data warehouse after schema changes of ISs. The concurrency of schema changes and data updates still remains an unexplored problem however. This paper now provides a first solution that guarantees concurrent view definition evolution and view extent maintenance of a DW defined over distributed ISs. For this problem, we introduce a framework called SDCC (Schema change and Data update Concurrency Control) system. SDCC integrates  existing algorithms designed to address view maintenance subproblems, such as view extent maintenance after IS data updates, view definition evolution after IS schema changes, and view extent adaptation after view definition changes, into one system by providing  protocols that enable them to correctly co-exist and collaborate. SDCC tracks any potential faulty updates of the DW ca...
