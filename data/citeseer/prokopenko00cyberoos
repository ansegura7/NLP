Cyberoos2000: Experiments with Emergent Tactical Behaviour this paper is that, rather than defining situated or tactical reasoning ad hoc, it is desirable to categorise agents according to their functionality and reactions to the environment, and identify corresponding classes of action theories and agent architectures. Then, the reasoning exhibited by agents of a certain type (and validated by particular action theories) can be declared to be situated, tactical, strategic, social and so on. In other words, the principal target is a systematic description of increasing levels of agent reasoning abilities. The results reported in [8, 9, 10] demonstrated that this is achievable at the situated level. Preliminary results on the systematic models for basic tactical behaviour were obtained as well [11]. This work intends to use this framework in experimenting with emergent tactical teamwork; and thus build up empirical results and intuition necessary to advance the systematic methodology towards collaborative goal-oriented agents.
