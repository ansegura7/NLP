Better Living Through Geometry Mark Weiser described ubiquitous computing as, ???invisible, everywhere computing that does not live on a personal device of any sort, but is in the woodwork everywhere.???[4] The EasyLiving project[1] is concerned with development of an architecture and technologies for ubiquitous computing environments which allow the dynamic aggregation of diverse I/O devices into a single coherent user experience. Though the need for research in distributed computing, perception, and interfaces is widely recognized, the importance of an explicit geometric world model for enhancing the user???s experience of a ubiquitous computing system has not been well-articulated. This paper introduces three scenarios which benefit from geometric context and describes the EasyLiving Geometric Model.
