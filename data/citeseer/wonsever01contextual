Contextual Rules for Text Analysis In this paper we describe a rule-based formalism for the analysis and  labelling of texts segments. The rules are contextual rewriting rules with a  restricted form of negation. They allow to underspecify text segments not  considered relevant to a given task and to base decisions upon context. A parser  for these rules is presented and consistence and completeness issues are  discussed. Some results of an implementation of this parser with a set of rules  oriented to the segmentation of texts in propositions are shown.
