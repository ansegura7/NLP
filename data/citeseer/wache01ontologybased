Ontology-Based Integration of Information - A Survey of Existing Approaches We review the use on ontologies for the integration  of heterogeneous information sources. Based  on an in-depth evaluation of existing approaches to  this problem we discuss how ontologies are used to  support the integration task. We evaluate and compare  the languages used to represent the ontologies  and the use of mappings between ontologies as well  as to connect ontologies with information sources.  We also ask for ontology engineering methods and  tools used to develop ontologies for information integration.  Based on the results of our analysis we  summarize the state of the art in ontology-based information  integration and name areas of further research  activities.  1 Motivation  The so-called information society demands for complete access to available information, which is often heterogeneous and distributed. In order to establish efficient information sharing, many technical problems have to be solved. First, a suitable information source must be located that might conta...
