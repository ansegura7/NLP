Active Rule Analysis And Optimisation In The Rock & Roll Deductive Object-Oriented Database Active database systems provide facilities that monitor and respond to changes of  relevance to the database. Active behaviour is normally described using Event Condition Action rules  (ECA-rules), and a number of systems have been developed, based upon different data models, that  support such rules. However, experience using active databases shows that while such systems are  powerful and potentially useful in many applications, they are hard to program and liable to exhibit  poor performance at runtime. This document addresses both of these issues by examining both analysis  and optimisation of active rules in the context of a powerful active database system. It is shown how  rule analysis methods developed for straightforward active rule languages for relational data models  can be extended to take account of rich event description languages and more powerful execution  models. It is also shown how the results of analyses can be exploited by rule optimisers, and that  multiple quer...
