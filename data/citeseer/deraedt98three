Three Companions for First Order Data Mining . Three companion systems, Claudien, ICL and Tilde, are presented. They use a common representation for examples and hypotheses: each example is represented by a relational database. This contrasts with the classical inductive logic programming systems such as Progol  and Foil. It is argued that this representation is closer to attribute value learning and hence more natural. Furthermore, the three systems can be considered first order upgrades of typical data mining systems, which induce association rules, classification rules or decision trees respectively. 1 Introduction  Typical data mining algorithms employ a limited attribute value representation, where each example consists of a single tuple in a relational database. This representation is inadequate for problem-domains that require reasoning about the structure of the domain, such as e.g. in bio-chemistry [7], natural language processing [14],. . . This paper presents three companion systems, where each example corresponds to a...
