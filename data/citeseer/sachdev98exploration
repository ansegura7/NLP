Explorations in Asynchronous Teams The subject of this thesis is the A-Teams formalism. This formalism facilitates the organization of multiple algorithms, encapsulated as autonomous agents, into cooperating teams to solve difficult problems. The ATeams formalism is one of many agent-based systems, and I start by providing a taxonomy of agent-based systems that allows us to see they how A-Teams relate to other agent-based systems. A-Teams are constructed from memories that store solutions and agents that work on those solutions. ATeams are open to the addition of new memories as well as of new agents. Sets of memories and agents can also be combined in different ways to create a variety of customized A-Teams. As new memories and agents are created, they can be added to existing repositories and reused for future applications. The automatic construction of problem-specific custom A-Teams from repositories of components has been a long standing goal of research in A-Teams. Current guidelines for A-Team construction requir...
