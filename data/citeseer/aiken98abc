ABC - An Intelligent Robocup Agent This paper will cover the basics of our virtual soccer team, ABC (Aiken, Benzacar, Cocosco) . It provides an overview of the agent's architecture, and in-depth explanation of its various modules. The agent's approach to achieving intelligent behavior, as contrasted with other approaches, is discussed. I. Introduction  The international RoboCup competition is held yearly and pits teams of simulated soccer-playing agents against each other. The simulated environment in which the agents interact is designed to reproduce the challenges associated with an embodied agent: the sensory information provided to each agent is incomplete, noisy, and sporadic. With this imperfect data as a base, the agents are challenged to behave as a cohesive team in attempting to win their matches. This paper discusses the design and implementation of an Artificially Intelligent RoboCup agent, ABC.  Its overall design is modeled after the architecture used by the winning team of the 1997 RoboCup competition, as ...
