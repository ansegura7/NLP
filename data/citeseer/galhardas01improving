Improving Data Cleaning Quality using a Data Lineage Facility The problem of data cleaning, which consists of  removing inconsistencies and errors from original  data sets, is well known in the area of decision  support systems and data warehouses. However,  for some applications, existing ETL (Extraction  Transformation Loading) and data cleaning  tools for writing data cleaning programs are insufficient.  One important challenge with them is the  design of a data flow graph that effectively generates  clean data. A generalized difficulty is the lack  of explanation of cleaning results and user interaction  facilities to tune a data cleaning program.  This paper presents a solution to handle this problem  by enabling users to express user interactions  declaratively and tune data cleaning programs.  1
