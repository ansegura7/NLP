Using Mobile Agents to implement flexible Network Management strategies Due to their intrinsic complexity, computer and communication systems require increasingly  more sophisticated management starategies to be adopted in order to guarantee adequate levels  of performance and reliability. The centralized paradigm adopted by the SNMP is appropriate  in several network management applications, but the quick expansion of networks has posed the  problem of its scalability, as well as for any other centralized model. Mobile agents represent a challenging  approach to provide advanced network management functionalities, due to the possibility  to easily implement a decentralized and active monitoring of the system. In this paper we discuss  how to take advantage of this technology and identify some reference scenario where mobile agents  represent a very promising approach. We also describe a prototype implementation based on our  mobile agent platform called MAP and show how it is possible to take advantages from using the  features it provides.  Keywords: net...
