VisualMOQL: The DISIMA Visual Query Language Multimedia data are now available to a variety of users ranging from naive to sophisticated. To make querying easy, visual query languages have been proposed. Most of these languages have a low expressive power and have their own query processors. Efforts have been made to design query languages with proper semantics to facilitate query optimization and processing in existing database systems. The majority of multimedia database systems are built on top of object or object-relational database systems with the underlying query facilities inherited. The DISIMA system is being built on top of a commercial OODBMS and we have chosen to extend the standard object-oriented query language OQL with some multimedia functionalities. The resulting language is called MOQL. This paper presents VisualMOQL, a visual query language implementing the image component of MOQL. 1 Introduction  In this paper we present the visual query interface, VisualMOQL, of the DISIMA distributed image database managemen...
