Virtual Keyboards This paper describes a novel scheme for vision-based human computer interaction in  which traditional input and output devices, monitors, keyboards and mice, are replaced with  augmented reality displays, projection systems and cameras. User input is accomplished by  projecting an image of the interface onto a flat surface in the scene which is monitored with  a video camera. The scheme hinges on the observation that the relationship between the  three surfaces of interest, the work surface, the virtual keyboard and the image obtained by  the camera, can be characterized by projective transformations of RP  2  . This observation  leads to a fast and accurate online calibration algorithm.  The basic advantage of the vision based interaction techniques proposed in this paper  is that they do not involve mechanical input devices such as keyboards, mice and touch  screens. There are no moving parts and no wires to connect to the interface surface. By  avoiding a physical instantiation of t...
