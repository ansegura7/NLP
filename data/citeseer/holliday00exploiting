Exploiting Planned Disconnections in Mobile Environments We present the notion of a distributed database made up entirely of mobile components. Since disconnections will be frequent in such an environment, we develop a disconnection and reconnection procedure to allow normal processing on the connected components. We briefly discuss a protocol based on epidemic communication to support such a system while ensuring one-copy serializability.  1 Introduction  Mobile computers and wireless networks are now being integrated into a variety of enterprises for different applications. The prevailing mode of operation with occasional disconnection by a single user will rapidly evolve into a situation where many if not all users are disconnecting and reconnecting in networks that are created in an ad hoc manner, e.g., a wireless network in a meeting room. This will result in mobile computers being integrated as first class entities in distributed information systems. Such mobile computers will inevitably contain data and information that will need to b...
