An Efficient Method for Performing Record Deletions and Updates Using Index Scans We present a method for efficiently performing deletions and updates of records when the records to be deleted or updated are chosen by a range scan on an index. The traditional method involves numerous unnecessary lock calls and traversals of the index from root to leaves, especially when the qualifying records' keys span more than one leaf page of the index. Customers have suffered performance losses from these inefficiencies and have complained about them. Our goal was to minimize the number of interactions with the lock manager, and the number of page fixes, comparison operations and, possibly, I/Os. Some of our improvements come from increased synergy between the query planning and data manager components of a DBMS. Our patented method has been implemented in DB2 V7 to address specific customer requirements. It has also been done to improve performance on the TPC-H benchmark. 1.
