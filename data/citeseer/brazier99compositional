Compositional Design and Reuse of a Generic Agent Model This paper introduces a formally specified design of a compositional generic agent model (GAM). This  agent model abstracts from specific application domains; it provides a unified formal definition of a model  for weak agenthood. It can be (re)used as a template or pattern for a large variety of agent types and  application domain types. The model was designed on the basis of experiences in a number of application  domains. The compositional development method DESIRE was used to design the agent model GAM at a  conceptual and logical level. It serves as a unified, precisely defined coneptual structure which can be  refined by specialisation and instantiation to a large variety of other, more specific agents. To illustrate  reuse of this agent model, specialisation and instantiation to model co-operative information gathering  agents is described in depth. Moreover, it is shown how GAM can be used to describe in a unified and  hence more comparable manner a large number of agent architectures from the literature.
