Automatic Text Summarization of Multiple Documents Scientists have retrieved what appear to be normal human eggs from human ovarian tissue that was grafted onto research mice. This is the first research group to obtain mature, potentially fertilizable eggs. Results of the research are being presented today at the conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. A report published last year demonstrated that ovarian tissue which was frozen and then replaced into a woman's body resulted in ovulation and menstruation. Such methods are being considered for women being treated for cancer with methods that would severely diminish or destroy their reproductive chances. However, there is concern that the retransplanted tissue might contain cancer cells. The current study proposes to reduce that risk. This is yet another step toward enabling women to freeze ovarian tissue in their early 20's, when it is generally most productive, to delay reproduction until their later years.
