Integrating Case-Based Learning and Cognitive Biases for Machine Learning of Natural Language This paper shows that psychological constraints on human information processing can be used effectively  to guide feature set selection for case-based learning of linguistic knowledge. Given as input a  baseline case representation for a natural language learning task, our algorithm selects the relevant cognitive  biases for the task and then automatically modifies the representation in response to those biases  by changing, deleting, and weighting features appropriately. We apply the cognitive bias approach to  feature set selection to four natural language learning problems and show that performance of the casebased  learning algorithm improves significantly when relevant cognitive biases are incorporated into the  baseline instance representation. We argue that the cognitive bias approach offers new possibilities for  case-based learning of natural language: it simplifies the process of instance representation design and, in  theory, obviates the need for separate instance represent...
