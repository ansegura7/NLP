The Vagabond Parallel Temporal Object-Oriented Database System: Versatile Support for Future Applications . In this paper, we discuss features that future database systems should support to deliver  the required functionality and performance to future applications. The most important features are  efficient support for: 1) large objects, 2) isochronous delivery of data, 3) queries on large data sets,  4) full text indexing, 5) multidimensional data, 6) sparse data, and 7) temporal data and versioning.  To efficiently support these features in one integrated system, a new database architecture is needed.  We describe an architecture suitable for this purpose, the Vagabond Parallel Temporal Object-Oriented  Database system. We also describe techniques we have developed to avoid some possible bottlenecks  in a system based on this new architecture.  1 Introduction  The recent years have brought computers into almost every office, and this availability of powerful computers, connected in global networks, has made it possible to utilize powerful data management systems in new application areas....
