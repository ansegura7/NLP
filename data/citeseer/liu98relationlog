Relationlog: A Typed Extension to Datalog with Sets and Tuples This paper presents a novel logic programming based language for nested relational and complex value models called Relationlog. It stands in the same relationship to the nested relational and complex value models as Datalog stands to the relational model. The main novelty of the language is the introduction of powerful mechanisms, namely, partial and complete set terms, for representing and manipulating both partial and complete information on nested sets, tuples and relations. They generalize the set grouping and set enumeration mechanisms of LDL and allow the user to directly encode the open and closed world assumptions on nested sets, tuples, and relations. They allow direct inference and access to deeply embedded values in a complex value relation as if the relation is normalized, which greatly increases the ease of use of the language. As a result, the extended relational algebra operations can be represented in Relationlog directly, and more importantly, recursively in a way similar to Datalog. Like Datalog, Relationlog has a well-defined Herbrand model-theoretic semantics, which captures the intended semantics of nested sets, tuples and relations, and also a well-defined proof-theoretic semantics which coincides with its model-theoretic semantics.
