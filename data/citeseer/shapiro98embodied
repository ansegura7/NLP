Embodied Cassie We have enhanced a computational cognitive agent by embodying it with real and simulated bodies operating in real and simulated worlds. This has allowed us to experiment with various ways that embodiment influences the creation and meaning of the agent's beliefs and other terms in its knowledge base, including: symbol-grounding by perception and action; firstperson privileged knowledge; the representation and use of indexicals; having a personal sense of time; and low-level bodily awareness.  Introduction  We have been engaged in a series of projects in which Cassie, the SNePS cognitive agent (Shapiro & Rapaport 1987; Shapiro 1989; Shapiro & Rapaport 1991; 1992; Shapiro & The SNePS Implementation Group 1998), has been incorporated into a hardware or softwaresimulated cognitive robot. The capabilities of the embodied Cassie have included: input and output in fragments of English; reasoning; performance of primitive and composite acts; and vision. In this paper, I give an overview of the...
