Three Companions for Data Mining in First Order Logic Three companion systems, Claudien, ICL and Tilde, are  presented. They use a common representation for examples and hypotheses:  each example is represented by a relational database. This contrasts  with the classical inductive logic programming systems such as  Progol and Foil. It is argued that this representation is closer to attribute  value learning and hence more natural.  Furthermore, the three systems can be considered first order upgrades of  typical data mining systems, which induce association rules, classification  rules or decision trees respectively.  1
