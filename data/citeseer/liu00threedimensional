Three-dimensional PC: toward novel forms of human-computer interaction The ongoing integration of IT systems is offering computer users a wide range of new (networked) services and the access to an explosively growing host of multimedia information. Consequently, apart from the currently established computer tasks, the access and exchange of information is generally considered as the driving computer application of the next decade. Major advances are required in the development of the human-computer interface, in order to enable end-users with the most varied backgrounds to master the added functionalities of their computers with ease, and to make the use of computers in general an enjoyable experience. Research efforts in computer science are concentrated on user interfaces that support the highly evolved human perception and interaction capabilities better than today's 2D graphic user interfaces with a mouse and keyboard. Thanks to the boosting computing power of general purpose computers, highly interactive interfaces are becoming feasible supporting a...
