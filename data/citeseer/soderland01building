Building a Machine Learning Based Text Understanding System Text understanding systems are approaching the  point of being a practical technology as long as the  system is trained for a narrowly defined domain.  Machine learning and statistical approaches can  minimize the effort involved in adapting a text  understanding system to a new domain.  This paper presents a system whose goal is deep  understanding, limited only by the necessity of  designing a formal representation of the target  concepts relevant to the domain. This system is an  advance over previous machine learning based  systems because of its richer output representation,  and an advance over equally expressive text  understanding systems because of its more  extensive use of machine learning.  1 Information Extraction from Free Text  A variety of systems have been developed in recent years that extract information from text. None of them attempts general-purpose understanding, but instead focus on narrowly defined information needs. A domain is defined as a collection of docum...
