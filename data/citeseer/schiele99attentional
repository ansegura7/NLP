Attentional Objects for Visual Context Understanding This paper exploits wearable computers' unique opportunity to record and index the visual environment of the user from the "first-person" perspective. We propose to use a hat-mounted wearable camera to record what the user sees during the day with a wearable computer.

An important aspect of the system is to automatically extract objects of user interest, and their motion within the environment and relative to the user.  1 Introduction  Wearable computers have the potential to "see" as the user sees, "hear" as the user hears, and experience the life and the environment of the user in a "first-person" sense.
