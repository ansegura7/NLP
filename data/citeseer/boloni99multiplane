A Multi-Plane State Machine Agent Model This paper presents a framework for implementing collaborative network agents. Agents  are assembled dynamically from components into a structure described by a multi-plane state  machine model. This organization lends itself to an elegant implementations of remote control,  collaboration, checkpointing and mobility, dening features of an agent system. It supports  techniques, like agent surgery dicult to reproduce with other approaches.  The reference implementation for our model, the Bond agent system, is distributed under  an open source license and can be downloaded from http://bond.cs.purdue.edu.  1 Introduction  The eld of agents is witnessing the convergence of researchers from several elds. Some see agents as a natural extension of the object-oriented programming paradigm, [14, 15]. One of the most popular books on articial intelligence reinterprets the whole eld in terms of agents [2]. Contemporary work on the theory of behavior provides the foundations for theoretical mo...
