Wearable Computing and the Remembrance Agent This paper gives an overview of the field of wearable computing. It covers the key differences between wearables and other portable computers, and discusses issues with the design and application for wearables. There then follows a specific example, the wearable remembrance agent --- a proactive memory aid. The paper concludes with discussion of future directions for research and applications inspired by using the prototype. 1. Introduction This scenario may sound some way off in practical terms, but it is not. All the technologies needed to support it are available. It is the aim of this paper to describe some of these technologies in more detail and give an indication of their current status. The paper will start by describing features available in wearable computers that are not available in current laptops or personal digital assistants (PDAs). It will then go on to describe a number of other general application areas for wearables and current wearable technologies and design needs. This is followed by a description of the remembrance agent (RA), a wearable memory aid that continually reminds the wearer of potentially relevant information based on the wearer's current physical and virtual context. Finally, the paper discusses extensions that are being added to the current prototype system. 2. What are wearable computers? The fuzzy definition of a wearable computer is that it is a computer that is always with the user, is comfortable and easy to keep and use, and is as unobtrusive as clothing. However, this `smart clothing' definition is unsatisfactory when the details are considered. Most importantly, it does not convey how a wearable computer is any different from a very small palm-top. A more specific definition is that wearable computers have many of the followin...
