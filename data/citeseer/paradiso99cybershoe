The CyberShoe: A Wireless Multisensor Interface for a Dancer's Feet : As a bridge between our interest in Wearable Computer systems and new performance interfaces for digital music, we have built a highly instrumented pair of sneakers for interactive dance. These shoes each measure 16 different, continuous parameters expressed by each foot and are able to transmit them wirelessly to a base station placed well over 30 meters away, updating all values up to 60 times per second. This paper describes our system, illustrates its performance, and outlines a few musical mappings that we have created for demonstrations in computer-augmented dance.  ____________________________________  Electronic sensors have been incorporated into footwear for several different applications over the last several years. Employing force-sensing resistor arrays or pixelated capacitive sensing, insoles with very dense pressure sampling have been developed for research at the laboratories of footwear manufacturers and pediatric treatment facilities (Cavanaugh, et. al., 1992).
