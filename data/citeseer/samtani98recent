Recent Advances and Research Problems in Data Warehousing . In the recent years, the database community has witnessed the emergence of a new technology, namely data warehousing. A data warehouse is a global repository that stores pre-processed queries on data which resides in multiple, possibly heterogeneous, operational or legacy sources. The information stored in the data warehouse can be easily and efficiently accessed for making effective decisions. The On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools access data from the data warehouse for complex data analysis, such as multidimensional data analysis, and decision support activities. Current research has lead to new developments in all aspects of data warehousing, however, there are still a number of problems that need to be solved for making data warehousing effective. In this paper, we discuss recent developments in data warehouse modelling, view maintenance, and parallel query processing. A number of technical issues for exploratory research are presented and possible solutions are discusse...
