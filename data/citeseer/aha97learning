Learning to Refine Case Libraries: Initial Results . Conversational case-based reasoning (CBR) systems, which incrementally extract a query description through a user-directed conversation, are advertised for their ease of use. However, designing large case libraries that have good performance (i.e., precision and querying efficiency) is difficult. CBR vendors provide guidelines for designing these libraries manually, but the guidelines are difficult to apply. We describe an automated inductive approach that revises conversational case libraries to increase their conformance with design guidelines. Revision increased performance on three conversational case libraries. 1 Introduction  In the context of the ECML-97 Workshop entitled Case-Based Learning: Beyond Classification of Feature Vectors, this paper's contribution focuses on using machine learning methods to assist in the design of case libraries. These libraries are designed for solution retrieval rather than classification tasks, and each case might contain a unique solution. Cas...
