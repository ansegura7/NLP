Information Extraction via Heuristics for a Movie Showtime Query System Semantic interpretation for limited-domain spoken dialogue systems often amounts to extracting information from utterances. For a system that provides movie showtime information, queries are classified along four dimensions: question type, and movie titles, towns and theaters that were mentioned. Simple heuristics suffice for constructing highly accurate classifiers for the latter three attributes; classifiers for the question type attribute are induced from data using features tailored to spoken language phenomena. Since separate classifiers are used for the four attributes, which are not independent, certain errors can be detected and corrected, thus increasing robustness. 1.
