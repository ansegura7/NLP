A Mutually Beneficial Integration of Data Mining and Information Extraction Text mining concerns applying data mining techniques to unstructured  text. Information extraction (IE) is a form of shallow  text understanding that locates specific pieces of data  in natural language documents, transforming unstructured  text into a structured database. This paper describes a system  called DISCOTEX, that combines IE and data mining  methodologies to perform text mining as well as improve  the performance of the underlying extraction system. Rules  mined from a database extracted from a corpus of texts are  used to predict additional information to extract from future  documents, thereby improving the recall of IE. Encouraging  results are presented on applying these techniques to a corpus  of computer job announcement postings from an Internet  newsgroup.
