Adaptive Navigation Support in Educational Hypermedia: the Role of Student Knowledge Level and the Case for Meta-Adaptation This paper provides a brief overview of main adaptive navigation support techniques and analyzes the results of most representative empirical studies of these techniques. It demonstrates an evidence that different known techniques work most efficiently in different context. In particular, the studies summarized in the paper have provided evidence that users with different knowledge level of the subject may appreciate different adaptive navigation support technologies. The paper argues that more empirical studies are required to help the developers of adaptive hypermedia systems in selecting most relevant adaptation technologies. It also attempts to build a case for meta-adaptive hypermedia systems, ie, systems that are able to adapt the very adaptation technology to the given user and context
