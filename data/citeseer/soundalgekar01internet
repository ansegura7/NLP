Internet search for Indian languages With the Internet growing at an exponential rate, no single search engine can index all of the web. It is therefore necessary to build specialized search engines that fulfill particular needs of a community of people. An example is Citeseer, which indexes research papers on the web. Also, as the web is increasingly hosting web pages in different languages, it is essential to be able to search for information stored in a specific language. For a search engine aimed at information in a particular language, an easy to use user interface is as essential as good response time and relevance of results. We introduce Shodh, a search engine for an Indian language. A prototype has been developed for selected set of pages and results are satisfactory. The user interface of the search engine includes both querying facilities as well as display of query results in the same language in which the information is stored. Contents 1
