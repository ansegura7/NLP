A Model of BDI-Agent in Game-Theoretic Framework . A model of BDI--agent in game--theoretic framework is presented. The desire is represented as agent's goal to achieve a maximum level of utility. A reasoning process based on agent's rational behavior  is proposed. This process determines agent's intention. It is also shown how to use the backward induction consistently with the assumption of the common knowledge of rationality. 1 Introduction  We are going to discuss the following problem:  How does a rational agent use its knowledge in decision making ?  Since the problem is general, we put it in a game--theoretic framework. In the theory of games, agent's rationality is understood as a way of maximizing the utility of the agent relatively to its knowledge. The knowledge may concern the game that is to be played as well as the agents participating in a play. The main task of the paper is to model BDI-agent that is supposed to live  in the world of dynamic games. Agent's belief is identified with the knowledge about the game and abo...
