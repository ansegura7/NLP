Network Management by Knowledge Distribution using Mobile Agents d to each other. Functionality provided by the different agents and managers are located at given places in the system. Such a system may have difficulties coping with a highly dynamic network environment.  By introducing mechanisms for moving programcode. a more flexible system can be designed. A specific part (e.g. an agent) having a certain set of abilities can be moved or move itself closer to (or even into) the NE in need of management. Bandwidth can be saved and "expert agents" can be utilised. Autonomous moving program code is known as mobile agents [3].  3 Collective behavior  When designing agents for complex problem solving you can either create a few highly advanced agents [2] or try to divide and distribute the problem solving task between a number of less complex agents. Mother nature can give several examples of successful implementations based on the latter strategy. An ant colony is such an example where a high number of less inte
