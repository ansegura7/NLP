Representation of behavioral history forl earningin nonstationary conditions A robot having to operate in nonstationary conditions needs to learn how to modify its control policy to adapt to the changing dynamics of the environment. Using the behavior-based approach to manage the interactions between the robot and its environment, we propose a method that models these interactions and adapts the selection of behaviors according to the history of behavior use. The learning and the use of this &quot;Interaction Model &quot; are validated using a vision- and sonar-based Pioneer I robot in the context of a multi-robot foraging task. Results show the effectiveness of the approach in taking advantage of any regularities experienced in the world, leading to fast and adaptable specialization for the learning robot. 1
