An Event-Condition-Action Language for XML XML repositories are now a widespread means for storing and exchanging information on the Web. As these repositories become increasingly used in dynamic applications such as e-commerce, there is a rapidly growing need for a mechanism to incorporate reactive functionality in an XML setting. Event-condition-action (ECA) rules are a technology from active databases and are a natural method for supporting such functionality. ECA rules can be used for activities such as automatically enforcing document constraints, maintaining repository statistics, and facilitating publish/subscribe applications. An important question associated with the use of a ECA rules is how to statically predict their run-time behaviour. In this paper, we de ne a language for ECA rules on XML repositories. We theninvestigate methods for analysing the behaviour of a set of ECA rules, ataskwhich has added complexity in this XML setting compared with conventional active databases. Keywords: Event-condition-action rules, XML, XML repositories, reactive functionality, rule analysis. 1
