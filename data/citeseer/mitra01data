Data Mining in Soft Computing Framework: A Survey The present article provides a survey of the available literature on data mining using soft computing. A categorization has been provided based on the di#erent soft computing tools and their hybridizations used, the data mining function implemented, and the preference criterion selected by the model. The utility of the di#erent soft computing methodologies is highlighted. Generally fuzzy sets are suitable for handling the issues related to understandability of patterns, incomplete/noisy data, mixed media information and human interaction, and can provide approximate solutions faster. Neural networks are non-parametric, robust, and exhibit good learning and generalization capabilities in data-rich environments. Genetic algorithms provide e#cient search algorithms to select a model, from mixed media data, based on some preference criterion/objective function. Rough sets are suitable for handling di#erent types of uncertainty in data. Some challenges to data mining and the application of soft computing methodologies are indicated. An extensive bibliography is also included. Keywords--- Knowledge discovery, rule extraction, fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, rough sets, neuro-fuzzy computing I.
