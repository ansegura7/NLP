Workload of a Media-Enhanced Classroom Server We charaterize a workload of media-enhanced classrooms. Such classrooms include equipment for presenting multimedia streams and for capturing streams of information (audio, video and notes) during a lecture. We present detailed quantitative performance measurements of one media-enhanced classroom system, Classroom 2000. We characterize the workload from the point of view of a server that supports multiple classrooms. The workload includes server bandwidth, network bandwidth and server storage requirements. We identify patterns in user behavior, and demonstrate how the number of simultaneous study sessions varies with time of day and with the proximity of a specific date to exams. 1 Workload of a Media-Enhanced Classroom Server 1 Introduction The ways we teach and learn will be dramatically affected by current, unprecedented rates of improvement in computational power and network bandwidth, as well as the development of innovative user interfaces and virtual environments.
