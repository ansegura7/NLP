A Tableau Calculus for Temporal Description Logic: The Expanding Domain Case . In this paper we present a tableau calculus for a temporal extension of the  description logic ALC, called T LALC . This logic is based on the temporal language with  `Until' interpreted over the natural numbers with expanding ALC-domains. The tableau  calculus forms an elaborated combination of Wolper's tableau calculus for propositional  linear temporal logic, the standard tableau-algorithm for ALC, and the method of quasimodels  as it has been introduced by Wolter and Zakharyaschev. Based on those three  ingredients the paper provides a new method of how tableau-based decision procedures  can be constructed for many-dimensional logics which lack the finite model property. The  method can be applied to deal with other temporalized formalisms as well.  1 Introduction  In many application domains of logic in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence it is no longer enough to describe the static aspect of the world. In particular, there is a need to formalize its temporal evolution...
