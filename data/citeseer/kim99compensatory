Compensatory Negotiation for Agent-Based Project Schedule Coordination Practitioners have tried to solve a project schedule coordination problem involving many subcontractors with a centralized approach, but failed to provide a cohesive solution. They have overlooked a principle that general contractors cannot coordinate subcontractors like they do their own forces. The project schedule coordination problem could be solved better by subcontractors in a distributed manner. This paper presents a formalized negotiation methodology for distributed project schedule coordination --- a framework wherein a project can be rescheduled dynamically by all of the concerned project participants. The compensatory negotiation methodology is developed to allow agents to transfer utility to other agents for compensation of disadvantageous agreements through a multi-linked negotiation process. By employing software agents that are capable of compensatory negotiation, practitioners now can solve the problem and explore and exploit new opportunities an agent-based framework offers.  1.
