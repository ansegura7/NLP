XML Declarative Description: A Language for the Semantic Web this document, you agree to all provisions of the copyright laws protecting it.  a Web resource's semantics. It employs XML as its bare syntax and enhances XML expressive power by employing Declarative Description theory.  8  A description in XDD is a set of ordinary XML elements, extended XML elements with variables, and the XML elements' relationships in terms of XML clauses. An ordinary XML element denotes a semantic unit and is a surrogate of an information item in the real application domain. An extended XML element represents implicit information or a set of semantic units. Clauses express rules, conditional relationships, integrity constraints, and ontological axioms. We define the precise and formal semantics of an XDD description as a set of ordinary XML elements, without employing other formalisms. Important axioms that are missing in XML and RDF but expressible in XDD include  symmetry, composition-of, and inverse  relations. As an example of the inverse-relation axiom, consider the XML clauses A and  B in Figure 1a. They model the Creator  and   PubRAy8"xW  properties' inverses assumed by some particular domain. Figure 1b then gives an example of representing an RDF statement C, "A creator of a document entitled `XDD language' is John." The semantics of an XDD description, which comprises the clauses A, B, and C, will also contain an RDF statement, "A publication of John is `XDD language"' (Figure 1c), hence allowing inverse inference of such implicit information. Obviously, this axiom cannot be represented in RDF. XDD can directly represent all XMLbased application markup languages. It also can simply represent XML applications that provide common conventions of semantics, syntax, and structures for certain specific domains. In addition to RDF, these domai...
