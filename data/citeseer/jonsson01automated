Automated State Abstraction for Options using the U-Tree Algorithm Learning a complex task can be significantly facilitated by defining a  hierarchy of subtasks. An agent can learn to choose between various  temporally abstract actions, each solving an assigned subtask, to accomplish  the overall task. In this paper, we study hierarchical learning using  the framework of options. We argue that to take full advantage of hierarchical  structure, one should perform option-specific state abstraction,  and that if this is to scale to larger tasks, state abstraction should be automated.  We adapt McCallum's U-Tree algorithm to automatically build  option-specific representations of the state feature space, and we illustrate  the resulting algorithm using a simple hierarchical task. Results  suggest that automated option-specific state abstraction is an attractive  approach to making hierarchical learning systems more effective.  1 Introduction  Researchers in the field of reinforcement learning have recently focused considerable attention on temporally abst...
