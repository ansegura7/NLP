Heterogeneous Multimedia Database Selection on the Web Multimedia databases on the Web have two distinct characteristics, autonomy and heterogeneity. They are established and maintained independently and queries are processed depending on their own schemes. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the database selection from a number of multimedia databases dispersed on the Web. In the multimedia objects retrieval from distributed sites, it is crucial that the metaserver has the capability to find objects, globally similar to a given query object, from different multimedia databases with different local similarity measures. We propose a novel selection algorithm to determine candidate databases that contain more objects relevant to the query than other databases. The selection of databases is based on the number of relevant objects at each local database that is estimated by using a few sample objects and the histogram information. An extensive experiment on a large number of real data sets demonstrates that our proposed method perform...
