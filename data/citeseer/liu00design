Design and Implementation of the ROL System ROL is a deductive object-oriented database system developed at the University of Regina. It eectively integrates important features of deductive databases and object-oriented databases in a uniform framework and provides a uniform rule-based declarative language for dening, manipulating and querying a database. This paper describes the latest implementation of ROL.  1 Introduction  In the past decade a lot of interests arose in integrating deductive and object-oriented databases to gain the best of the two approaches such as recursion, declarative querying, and rm logical foundations from deductive approaches, and object identity, complex objects, classes, class hierarchy, property inheritance with overriding and schema from object-oriented approach. A number of deductive object-oriented database languages have been proposed, such as O-logic [17], revised O-logic [11], C-logic [8], IQL [2], IQL2[1], Flogic [10], LOGRES [7], LLO [16], LOL [6], CORAL++[19], Datalog  method  [3], DLT ...
