The Distributed Simulation of Multi-Agent Systems Agent-based systems are increasingly being applied in a wide range of areas including telecommunications, business process modelling, computer games, control of mobile robots and military simulations. Such systems are typically extremely complex and it is often useful to be able to simulate an agent-based system to learn more about its behaviour or investigate the implications of alternative architectures. In this paper, we discuss the application of distributed discrete-event simulation techniques to the simulation of multi-agent systems. We identify the efficient distribution of the agents' environment as a key problem in the simulation of agent-based systems, and present an approach to the decomposition of the environment which facilitates load balancing.
