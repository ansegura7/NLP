Measuring Search Engine Quality The effectiveness of twenty public search engines is evaluated using TREC-inspired methods  and a set of 54 queries taken from real Web search logs. The World Wide Web is taken as the  test collection and a combination of crawler and text retrieval system is evaluated. The engines  are compared on a range of measures derivable from binary relevance judgments of the first  seven live results returned. Statistical testing reveals a significant difference between engines  and high inter-correlations between measures. Surprisingly, given the dynamic nature of the  Web and the time elapsed, there is also a high correlation between results of this study and  a previous study by Gordon and Pathak. For nearly all engines, there is a gradual decline  in precision at increasing cutoff after some initial fluctuation. Performance of the engines as  a group is found to be inferior to the group of participants in the TREC-8 Large Web task,  although the best engines approach the median of those systems. Shortcomings of current  Web search evaluation methodology are identified and recommendations are made for future  improvements. In particular, the present study and its predecessors deal with queries which are  assumed to derive from a need to find a selection of documents relevant to a topic. By contrast,  real Web search reflects a range of other information need types which require different judging  and different measures.
