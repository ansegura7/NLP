Version Space Algebra and its Application to Programming by Demonstration Machine learning research has been very  successful at producing powerful, broadlyapplicable  classification learners. However,  many practical learning problems do not fit  the classification framework well, and as a  result the initial phase of suitably formulating  the problem and incorporating the relevant  domain knowledge can be very di#cult  and typically consumes the majority of the  project time. Here we propose a framework  to systematize and speed this process, based  on the notion of version space algebra. We  extend the notion of version spaces beyond  concept learning, and propose that carefullytailored  version spaces for complex applications  can be built by composing simpler, restricted  version spaces. We illustrate our  approach with SMARTedit, a programming  by demonstration application for repetitive  text-editing that uses version space algebra  to guide a search over text-editing action sequences.  We demonstrate the system on a  suite of repetitive text-editing ...
