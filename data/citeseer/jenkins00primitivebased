Primitive-Based Movement Classification for Humanoid Imitation . Motor control is a complex problem and imitation is a powerful mechanism for acquiring new motor  skills. In this paper, we describe perceptuo-motor primitives, a biologically-inspired notion for a basis set of  perceptual and motor routines. Primitives serve as a vocabulary for classifying and imitating observed human  movements, and are derived from the imitator's motor repertoire. We describe a model of imitation based  on such primitives and demonstrate the feasibility of the model in a constrained implementation. We present  approximate motion reconstruction generated from visually captured data of typically imitated tasks taken from  aerobics, dancing, and athletics.  1 Introduction  Imitation is a powerful mechanism for acquiring new skills. It involves an intricate interaction between perceptual and motor mechanisms, both of which are complex in themselves. Research into vision and motor control has explored the role of "subroutines", schemas [1], and other variants based on ...
