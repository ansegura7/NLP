WebMate: A Personal Agent for Browsing and Searching The World-Wide Web is developing very fast. Currently, #nding useful information  on the Web is a time consuming process. In this paper, we presentWebMate, an  agent that helps users to e#ectively browse and search the Web. WebMate extends  the state of the art in Web-based information retrieval in manyways. First, it uses  multiple TF-IDF vectors to keep track of user interests in di#erent domains. These  domains are automatically learned byWebMate. Second, WebMate uses the Trigger  Pair Model to automatically extract keywords for re#ning document search. Third,  during search, the user can provide multiple pages as similarity#relevance guidance  for the search. The system extracts and combines relevantkeywords from these relevant  pages and uses them for keyword re#nement. Using these techniques, WebMate  provides e#ective browsing and searching help and also compiles and sends to users  personal newspaper by automatically spiding news sources. Wehave experimentally  evaluated the performance of the system.
