Speech/Gesture Interface to a Visual Computing Environment for Molecular Biologists In recent years there has been tremendous progress in 3D, immersive display and virtual reality (VR) technologies. Scientific visualization of data is one of many applications that has benefited from this progress. To fully exploit the potential of these applications in the new environment there is a need for "natural" interfaces that allow the manipulation of such displays without burdensome attachments. This paper describes the use of visual hand gesture analysis enhanced with speech recognition for developing a bimodal gesture/speech interface for controlling a 3-D display. The interface augments an existing application, VMD, which is a VR visual computing environment for molecular biologists. The free hand gestures are used for manipulating the 3-D graphical display together with a set of speech commands. We concentrate on the visual gesture analysis techniques used in developing this interface. The dual modality of gesture/speech is found to greatly aid the interaction capability....
