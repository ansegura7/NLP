Feasible Formations of Multi-Agent Systems Formations of multi-agent systems, such as mobile robots, satellites. and aircraft, require individual agents to satisfy their kinematic equations while constantly maintaining inter-agent constraints. In this paper, we develop a systematic framework for studying formation feasibility of multi-agent systems. In particular, we consider undirected formations for centralized formations, and directed formations for decentralized formations. In each case, we determine differential geometric conditions that guarantee formation feasibility given the individual agent kinematics. Our framework also enables us to extract a smaller control system that describes the group kinematics while maintaining all formation constraints.
