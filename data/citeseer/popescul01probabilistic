Probabilistic Models for Unified Collaborative and Content-Based Recommendation in Sparse-Data Environments Recommender systems leverage product and  community information to target products to  consumers. Researchers have developed collaborative  recommenders, content-based recommenders,  and a few hybrid systems. We propose  a unified probabilistic framework for merging  collaborative and content-based recommendations.  We extend Hofmann's (1999) aspect  model to incorporate three-way co-occurrence  data among users, items, and item content. The  relative influence of collaboration data versus  content data is not imposed as an exogenous parameter,  but rather emerges naturally from the  given data sources. However, global probabilistic  models coupled with standard EM learning algorithms  tend to drastically overfit in the sparsedata  situations typical of recommendation applications.  We show that secondary content information  can often be used to overcome sparsity.  Experiments on data from the ResearchIndex  library of Computer Science publications  show that appropriate mixture models incorporating  secondary data produce significantly better  quality recommenders than k-nearest neighbors  (k-NN). Global probabilistic models also allow  more general inferences than local methods like  k-NN.
