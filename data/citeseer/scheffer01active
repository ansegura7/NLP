Active Learning of Partially Hidden Markov Models We consider the task of learning hidden Markov models (HMMs) when only partially (sparsely) labeled observation sequences are available for training. This setting is motivated by the information extraction problem, where only few tokens in the training documents are given a semantic tag while most tokens are unlabeled. We first describe the partially hidden Markov model together with an algorithm for learning HMMs from partially labeled data. We then present an active learning algorithm that selects "difficult" unlabeled tokens and asks the user to label them. We study empirically by how much active learning reduces the required data labeling effort, or increases the quality of the learned model achievable with a given amount of user effort.
