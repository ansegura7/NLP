Some Thoughts on Transiently Shared Dataspaces Transiently Shared Dataspaces (TSD), recently introduced in the coordination infrastructure Lime, represent an emerging technology to enable the use of dataspaces for the coordination of mobile agents: data-sharing is allowed among agents running on hosts belonging to the same federation (i.e., currently connected). In this paper we present a formalization of the TSD technology in order to provide a framework for reasoning about systems based on this infrastructure. In particular, we concentrate on alternative design choices related to data migration, host connectivity, and reactive programming. 1
