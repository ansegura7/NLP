Hybrid Coordination of Reinforcement Learning-based Behaviors for AUV Control This paper proposes a Hybrid Coordination method for Behavior-based Control Architectures. The hybrid method takes in advantages of the robustness and modularity in competitive approaches as well as optimized trajectories in cooperative ones. This paper will demonstrate the feasibility of this hybrid method with a 3D-navigation application to an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The behaviors were learnt online by means of Reinforcement Learning. Q(l)- learning was used extending the one-step learning of the popular Q-learning to n-steps. Realistic simulations were carried out. Results showed the good performance of the hybrid method on behavior coordination as well as on increasing and improving behavior learning.
