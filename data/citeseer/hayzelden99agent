Agent Technology in Communications Systems: An Overview Telecommunications infrastructures are a natural application domain for the distributed Software Agent  paradigm. The authors clarify the potential application of software agent technology in legacy and future  communications systems, and provide an overview of publicly available research on software agents as  used for network management. The authors focus on the so called "stationary intelligent agent" type of  software agent, although the paper also reviews the reasons why mobile agents have made an impact in  this domain. The authors' objective is to describe some of the intricacies of using the software agent  approach in the management of communications systems. The paper is in four main sections. The first  section provides a brief introduction to software agent technology. The second section considers general  problems of network management and the reasons why software agents may provide a suitable solution.  The third section reviews some selected research on agents in a telec...
