A Neural Network Model for Monotonic Diagnostic Problem Solving The task of diagnosis is to find a hypothesis that best explains a set of manifestations (observations). Generally, it is computationally expensive to find a hypothesis because the number of the potential hypotheses is exponentially large. Recently, many efforts have been made to find parallel processing methods to solve the above difficulty. In this paper, we propose a neural network model for diagnostic problem solving where a diagnostic problem is treated as a combinatorial optimisation problem. One feature of the model is that the causal network is directly used as the network. Another feature is that the errors between the observations and the current activations of manifestation nodes are used to guide the network computing for finding optimal diagnostic hypotheses.   1 Introduction  For a set of manifestations(observations), the diagnostic inference is to find the most plausible faults or disorders which can explain why the manifestations are present. In general, an individual d...
