A Multi-Agent Approach to Vehicle Monitoring in Motorway . This paper describes CaseLP, a prototyping environment for MultiAgent  Systems (MAS), and its adoption for the development of a distributed industrial  application. CaseLP employs architecture definition, communication,  logic and procedural languages to model a MAS from the top-level architecture  down to procedural behavior of each agent's instance. The executable specification  which is obtained can be employed as a rapid prototype which helps in  taking quick decisions on the best possible implementation solutions. Such capabilities  have been applied to a distributed application of Elsag company, in order  to assess the best policies for data communication and database allocation before  the concrete implementation. The application consists in remote traffic control  and surveillance over service areas on an Italian motorway, employing automatic  detection and car plate reading at monitored gates. CaseLP allowed to predict  data communication performance statistics under differe...
