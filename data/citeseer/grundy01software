Software Tools Software is growing ever-more complex and new software processes, methods and products put greater demands on software engineers than ever before. The support of appropriate software tools is essential for developers to maximise their ability to effectively and efficiently deliver quality software products. This article surveys current practice in the software tools area, along with recent and expected near-future trends in software tools development. We provide a summary of tool applications during the software lifecycle, but focus on particular aspects of software tools that have changed in recent years and are likely to change in the near future as tools continue to evolve. These include the internal structure of tools, provision of multiple view interfaces, tool integration techniques, collaborative work support and the increasing use of automated assistance within tools. We hope this article will both inform software engineering practitioners of current research trends, and tool researchers of the relevant state-of-the-art in commercial tools and various likely future research trends in tools development.
