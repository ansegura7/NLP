ConfSeek - A Multi-user, Multi-Threaded Specialized Search Engine for Conferences The explosive growth of the World Wide Web - the latest estimates for its size are around 1,000,000,000 web-pages - has made critical the need to nd information more accurately than what the current generic search engines can deliver. This project implements a prototype specialized search engine that allows user to submit queries for conferences in a specic eld of interest, and returns the detailed information about those conferences (deadlines, etc.). It uses multiple existing search engines to provide better coverage of the information available on the Internet. It can interact with multiple users concurrently and makes use of multi-threading to achieve faster information processing.  The goal is to make this tool available to the scientic community to provide researchers with improved access to conference information. We discuss possible extensions (e.g. ranking of conferences according to their `quality', trip planning, etc.).  Contents  1 Introduction 2 2 Goals of this Project...
