Optimizing Global-Local Search Hybrids This paper develops a framework for optimizing global-local hybrids of search or optimization procedures. The paper starts by idealizing the search problem as a search by a global algorithm G for either (1) acceptable targets---solutions that meet a specified criterion---or for (2) basins of attraction that then lead to acceptable targets under a specified local search algorithm L. The paper continues by abstracting two sets of parameters, probabilities of successfully hitting targets and basins and time-to-criterion coefficients. With these parameters, equations may be written to account for the total time of search and for the probabilistic success (reliability) in reaching an acceptable solution. Thereafter, optimization problems are formulated in which the division of local versus global search time is optimized so that solution time to acceptable reliability is minimized or reliability under specified solution time is maximized. A two-basin optimality criterion is derived and appl...
