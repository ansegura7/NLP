Calibrating Parameters of Cost Functionals We propose a new framework for calibrating parameters of energy  functionals, as used in image analysis. The method learns parameters  from a family of correct examples, and given a probabilistic construct  for generating wrong examples from correct ones. We introduce a  measure of frustration to penalize cases in which wrong responses are  preferred to correct ones, and we design a stochastic gradient algorithm  which converges to parameters which minimize this measure of  frustration. We also present a first set of experiments in this context,  and introduce extensions to deal with data-dependent energies.  keywords: Learning, variational method, parameter estimation, image reconstruction, Bayesian image models  1  1 Description of the method  Many problems in computer vision are addressed through the minimization of a cost functional U . This function is typically defined on a large, finite, set \Omega  (for example the set of pictures with fixed dimensions), and the minimizer of x ...
