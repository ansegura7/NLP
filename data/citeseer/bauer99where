"Where Are You Pointing At?" A Study of Remote Collaboration in a Wearable Videoconference System This paper reports on an empirical study aimed at evaluating the utility of a reality-augmenting telepointer in a wearable videoconference system. Results show that using this telepointer a remote expert can effectively guide and direct a field worker's manual activities. By analyzing verbal communication behavior and pointing gestures, we were able to determine that experts overwhelmingly preferred pointing for guiding workers through physical tasks.
