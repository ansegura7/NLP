Who do you want to be today? Web Personae for personalised information access Personalised context sensitivity is the Holy Grail of web information retrieval. As a first step towards this goal, we present the Web Personae personalised search and browsing system. We use well-known information retrieval techniques to develop and track user models. Web Personae differ from previous approaches in that we model users with multiple profiles, each corresponding to a distinct topic or domain. Such functionality is essential in heterogeneous environments such as the Web. We introduce Web Personae, describe an algorithm for learning such models from browsing data, and discuss applications and evaluation methods.
