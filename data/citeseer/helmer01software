Software Fault Tree and Colored Petri Net Based Specification, Design and Implementation of Agent-Based Intrusion Detection Systems The integration of Software Fault Tree (SFT) which describes intrusions and Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) which specifies design, is examined for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The IDS under development is a collection of mobile agents that detect, classify, and correlate system and network activities. Software Fault Trees (SFTs), augmented with nodes that describe trust, temporal, and contextual relationships, are used to describe intrusions. CPNs for intrusion detection are built using CPN templates created from the augmented SFTs. Hierarchical CPNs are created to detect critical stages of intrusions. The agent-based implementation of the IDS is then constructed from the CPNs. Examples of intrusions and descriptions of the prototype implementation are used to demonstrate how the CPN approach has been used in development of the IDS. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to systematic specification, design, and implementation of an IDS. Innovations include (1) using stages of intrusions to structure the specification and design of the IDS, (2) augmentation of SFT with trust, temporal, and contextual nodes to model intrusions, (3) algorithmic construction of CPNs from augmented SFT, and (4) generation of mobile agents from CPNs. 1
