Autonomous Compliant Motion: the Bayesian approach This paper gives an overview of the dierent levels of sensor processing complexity found in forcecontrolled tasks, and explains which techniques from Bayesian probability theory are appropriate to cope with uncertainties and missing information at each of the dierent levels. The paper reduces all approaches for \intelligent" compliant motion sensor processing to a basic set of just four classes. Some of these algorithms have already been tested experimentally, while others are still beyond the current state-of-theart. The major contribution of this paper is to bring a clear structure to the eld, which should eventually result in an easier integration of dierent research results, and a more precise discussion about their relative merits and innovations.  1 Introduction  Force sensors are only one of many possible sensors that make robot controllers more autonomous, i.e., make them work in an environment that need not be as modelled and structured as the current industrial settings i...
