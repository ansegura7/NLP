Analysis and Design using MaSE and agentTool This paper provides an overview of the work being done at the Air Force Institute of Technology on the Multiagent Systems Engineering methodology and the associated agentTool environment. Our research is focused on discovering methods and techniques for engineering practical multiagent systems. It uses the abstraction provided by multiagent systems for developing intelligent, distributed software systems.
