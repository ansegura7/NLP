Applying Artificial Intelligence to Virtual Reality: Intelligent Virtual Environments Reearch into virtual environments on the one hand and artificial intelligence and artificial life  on the other has largely been carried out by two different groups of people with different preoccupations  and interests, but some convergence is now apparent between the two fields. Applications  in which activity independent of the user takes place --- involving crowds or other agents --- are  beginning to be tackled, while synthetic agents, virtual humans and computer pets are all areas in  which techniqes from the two fields require strong integration. The two communities have much  to learn from each other if wheels are not to be reinvented on both sides. This paper reviews  the issues arising from combining artificial intelligence and artificial life techniques with those  of virtual environments to produce just such intelligent virtual environments. The discussion is  illustrated with examples that include environments providing knowledge to direct or assist the  user rather than r...
