On Bounding-Schemas for LDAP Directories . As our world gets more networked, ever increasing amounts  of information are being stored in LDAP directories. While LDAP directories  have considerable flexibility in the modeling and retrieval of  information for network applications, the notion of schema they provide  for enabling consistent and coherent representation of directory information  is rather weak. In this paper, we propose an expressive notion  of bounding-schemas for LDAP directories, and illustrate their practical  utility. Bounding-schemas are based on lower bound and upper bound  specifications for the content and structure of an LDAP directory. Given  a bounding-schema specification, we present algorithms to efficiently determine:  (i) if an LDAP directory is legal w.r.t. the bounding-schema,  and (ii) if directory insertions and deletions preserve legality. Finally,  we show that the notion of bounding-schemas has wider applicability,  beyond the specific context of LDAP directories.  1 Introduction  X.500 styl...
