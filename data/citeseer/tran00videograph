VideoGraph: A Graphical Object-based Model for Representing and Querying Video Data . Modeling video data poses a great challenge since they do  not have as clear an underlying structure as traditional databases do.  We propose a graphical object-based model, called VideoGraph, in this  paper. This scheme has the following advantages: (1) In addition to semantics  of video individual events, we capture their temporal relationships  as well. (2) The inter-event relationships allow us to deduce implicit  video information. (3) Uncertainty can also be handled by associating the  video event with a temporal Boolean-like expression. This also allows us  to exploit incomplete information. The above features make VideoGraph  very flexible in representing various metadata types extracted from diverse  information sources. To facilitate video retrieval, we also introduce  a formalism for the query language based on path expressions. Query  processing involves only simple traversal of the video graphs.  1 Introduction  We deal with the modeling aspect of video database manageme...
