Guided by Voices: An Audio Augmented Reality System This paper presents an application of a low cost, lightweight audio-only augmented reality infrastructure. The system uses a simple wearable computer and a RF based location system to play digital sounds corresponding to the user's location and current state. Using this infrastructure we implemented a game in the fantasy genre where players move around in the real world and trigger actions in the virtual game world. We present some of the issues involved in creating audio-only augmented reality games and show how our location infrastructure is generalizable to other audio augmented realities.  Keywords  Audio, augmented reality, wearable computing, context-awareness  INTRODUCTION  This paper presents a lightweight and inexpensive infrastructure for augmented realities that uses a simple wearable computer. Whereas most traditional augmented reality systems overlay graphics onto the user's environment, this system employs only audio. Furthermore, we have created a positioning infrastruct...
