Image Retrieval: Current Techniques, Promising Directions And Open Issues This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the technical achievements in the research area of image retrieval, especially content-based image retrieval, an area that has been so active and prosperous in the past few years. The survey includes 100+ papers covering the research aspects of image feature representation and extraction, multidimensional indexing, and system design, three of the fundamental bases of content-based image retrieval. Furthermore, based on the state-of-the-art technology available now and the demand from real-world applications, open research issues are identified and future promising research directions are suggested.
