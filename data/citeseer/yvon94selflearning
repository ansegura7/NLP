Self-Learning Techniques for Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion In this article, we present a comprehensive review of various experiences with different self-learning techniques applied to the task of converting a graphemic string into the corresponding phonemic sequence. We also report some experiments carried out both with English words and French proper names. These experiments support the view that taking full advantage of the huge pronunciation dictionaries that we have been developing during the ONOMASTICA project is possible only if the traditional understanding of grapheme-tophoneme conversion as a classification problem is questioned.
