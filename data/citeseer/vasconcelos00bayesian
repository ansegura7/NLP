Bayesian Representations and Learning Mechanisms for Content-Based Image Retrieval We have previously introduced a Bayesian framework for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) that relies on a generative model for feature representation based on embedded mixtures. This is a truly generic image representation that can jointly model color and texture and has been shown to perform well across a broad spectrum of image databases. In this paper, we expand the Bayesian framework along two directions.  First, we show that the formulation of CBIR as a problem of Bayesian inference leads to a natural criteria for evaluating local image similarity without requiring any image segmentation. This allows the practical implementation of retrieval systems where users can provide image regions, or objects, as queries. Region-based queries are significantly less ambiguous than queries based on entire images leading to significant improvements in retrieval precision.  Second, we present a Bayesian learning algorithm that relies on belief propagation to integrate feedback provided by the...
