PKDD'98 Tutorial on Scalable, High-Performance Data Mining with Parallel Processing Contents 1 Introduction 2 Overview of 7 different approaches for speeding up data mining in large databases 3 An overview of parallel processing for data mining 4 Parallel rule induction 5 Parallel Instance-Based Learning 6 Parallel Genetic Algorithms 7 Parallel Neural Networks 8 Conclusions  Introduction.  Problem: How to perform efficient data mining in very large databases. Natural solution: parallelism Performance issues:  any sequential data mining algorithm: O(N) parallelism reduces this lower bound to O(N/p) (N = No. of tuples, p = No. of processors) Cost-benefit issues:  many data warehouses are already implemented on cost-effective parallel database servers  2 Overview of 7 different approaches for speeding up data mining in large databases. Data-Oriented Approaches: (1) Sampling (reduces number of tuples) (2) Attribute selection (reduces number of attributes) (3) Discretization (reduces number of values of attributes, which in
