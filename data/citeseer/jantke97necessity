The Necessity Of User Guidance In Case-Based Knowledge Acquisition The intention of the present paper is to justify both theoretically and experimentally that user guidance is inevitable in case-based knowledge acquisition. The methodology of our approach is simple: We choose some paradigmatic idea of case-based learning which can be very briefly expressed as follows:  Given any CBR system, apply it. Whenever it works sucessfully, do not change it. Whenever it fails on some input case, add this experience to the case base. Don't do anything else. Then, we perform a number of knowledge acquisition experiments. They clearly exhibit essential limitations of knowledge acquisition from randomly chosen cases. As a consequence, we develop scenarios of user guidance. Based on these theoretical concepts, we prove a few theoretical results characterizing the power of our approach. Next, we perform a new series of more constrained results which support our theoretical investigations. This paper is based on more than 1 000 000 runs of case-based knowledge acquisi...
