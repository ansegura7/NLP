Bringing People and Places Together with Dual Augmentation This paper describes initial work on the Domisilica project at Georgia Tech. We are exploring the dual augmentation of physical and virtual worlds in Domisilica and applying this novel concept to support home life beyond the boundaries of the actual house. We will demonstrate applications of dual augmentation in supporting distributed communities through a home (the Regency) and a specific appliance (CyberFridge), both of which serve as a communications link between physical and virtual worlds. Three specific types of communication are supported: direct (supporting real-time user-to-user interaction), indirect (interaction mediated by devices such as games, a refrigerator, etc), and peripheral (supporting awareness of subtle information). Keywords: Augmented reality, augmented virtuality, home, ubiquitous computing 1 Introduction Physical barriers such as time and distance have traditionally stood in the way of successfully building communities which are not located in a single geogr...
