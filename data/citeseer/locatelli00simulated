Simulated Annealing Algorithms For Continuous Global Optimization INTRODUCTION  In this paper we consider Simulated Annealing algorithms (SA in what follows) applied to continuous global optimization problems, i.e. problems with the following form  f  = min  x2X  f(x); (1.1) where X ` !  n  is a continuous domain, often assumed to be compact, which, combined with the continuity or lower semicontinuity of f , guarantees the existence of the minimum value f  . SA algorithms are based on an analogy with a physical phenomenon: while at high temperatures the molecules in a liquid move freely, if the temperature is slowly decreased the thermal mobility of the molecules is lost and they form a pure crystal which also corresponds to a state of minimum energy. If the temperature is decreased too quickly (the so called quenching) a liquid metal rather ends up in a polycrystalline or amorphous state with
