Top N optimization issues in MM databases Introduction  In multi media (MM) DBMSs the usual way of operation in case of a MM retrieval query is to compute some ranking based on statistics and distances in feature spaces. The MM objects are then sorted by descending relevance relative to the given query. Since users are limited in their capabilities of reviewing all objects in that ranked list only a reasonable top of say N objects is returned.  However, this can turn out to be a quite time consuming process. The first reason is that the number of objects (i.e. documents) in the DBMS is usually very large (10  6  or even more). From the information retrieval field it is known that usually half of all objects (e.g. documents) contains at least one query term; so, even considering only these objects might be very time consuming. The same may hold for MM in general.  The problem of top N MM query optimization is to find techniques to limit the set of objects taken into consideration during the
