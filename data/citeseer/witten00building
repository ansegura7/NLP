While many indexes  to the World Wide Web are freely available, the quality of what is indexed is  extremely uneven. The digital analog of a public library---a reliable, quality,  community service---has yet to appear. This paper demonstrates the feasibility  of a cost-effective collection of high-quality public-domain information,  available free over the Internet.

Without a title, author and subject database it  seems hard to offer the searching facilities normally available in physical  libraries. Full-text retrieval provides a way of approximating these services  without a concomitant investment of resources. A second is the problem of  finding a suitable corpus of material.
