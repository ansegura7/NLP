A Data Model and Algebra for Probabilistic Complex Values . We present a probabilistic data model for complex values. More precisely, we introduce  probabilistic complex value relations, which combine the concept of probabilistic relations with  the idea of complex values in a uniform framework. We elaborate a model-theoretic definition of  probabilistic combination strategies, which has a rigorous foundation on probability theory. We  then define an algebra for querying database instances, which comprises the operations of selection,  projection, renaming, join, Cartesian product, union, intersection, and difference. We prove that  our data model and algebra for probabilistic complex values generalizes the classical relational data  model and algebra. Moreover, we show that under certain assumptions, all our algebraic operations  are tractable. We finally show that most of the query equivalences of classical relational algebra carry  over to our algebra on probabilistic complex value relations. Hence, query optimization techniques  for class...
