Development and Characterization of an Acoustic Rangefinder Localization is important to wearable and embedded applications at many levels. For example, it might be used to implement \physical" user interfaces which detect body language or the user's positioning of objects in the environment. This paper presents the initial results of a prototype implementation of an acoustic rangender. Unlike other published work in this area, this design uses a sliding correlator to detect the acoustic signal. This technique signicantly improves performance in obstructed and noisy environments. Ongoing work towards a more compact implementation and towards new protocols for establishing coordinate systems is also described.  1 Introduction  When the members of our research group are brainstorming applications for our soon-to-be-indispensible ad-hoc networked sensor technology, we often run into the same brick wall: how do we do anything that is physically motivated and context aware without localization ? Virtually every application we propose degenerates t...
