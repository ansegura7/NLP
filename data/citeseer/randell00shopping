The Shopping Jacket: Wearable Computing for the Consumer . As part of the Bristol Wearable Computing Initiative we are  exploring location sensing systems suitable for use with Wearable Computing.  In this paper we present our findings, and in particular a wearable  application - the 'Shopping Jacket' - which relies on a minimal infrastructure  to be effective. We use two positioning devices, 'Pingers' and  GPS. The Pinger is used to signal the presence of a shop, and to indicate  the type of shop and it's website. The GPS is used to disambiguate  which branch of a high street chain we are passing. The wearable uses  this information to determine whether the wearer needs to be alerted  that they are passing an interesting shop, or to direct the wearer around  a shopping mall.  The shopping jacket integrates a wearable CardPC; GPS and Pinger  receivers; a near-field radio link; hand-held display; GSM data telephone;  and a speech interface into a conventional sports blazer.  Keywords - wearable computer, location sensing, GPS, pinger, shoppin...
