Running the Web Backwards: Appliance Data Services Appliance" digital devices such as handheld cameras, scanners, and microphones generate data that people want to put on Web pages. Unfortunately, numerous complex steps are required. Contrast this with Web output: handheld web browsers enjoy increasing infrastructural support such as user-transparent transformation proxies, allowing unmodified Web pages to be conveniently viewed on devices not originally designed for the task. We hypothesize that the utility of input appliances will be greatly increased if they too were "infrastructure enabled." Appliance Data Services attempts to systematically describe the task domain of providing seamless and graceful interoperability between input appliances and the Web. We offer an application architecture and a validating prototype that we hope will "open up the playing field" and motivate further work. Our initial efforts have identified two main design challenges: dealing with device heterogeneity, and providing a "no-futz" out-of-the-box user experience for novices without sacrificing expressive power for advanced users. We address heterogeneity by isolating device and protocol heterogeneity considerations into a single extensible architectural component, allowing most of the application logic to deal exclusively with Web-friendly protocols and formats. We address the user interface issue in two ways: first, by specifying how to tag input with commands that specify how data is to be manipulated once injected into the infrastructure; second, by describing a late-binding mechanism for these command tags, which allows "natural" extensions of the device's UI for application selection and minimizes the amount of configuration required before end-users benefit from Appliance Data Services. Finally, we describe how to leverage existi...
