The Importance of Being Mobile: Some Social Consequences of Wearable Augmented Reality Systems What are the consequences of mobility for augmented reality ? This brief paper explores some of the issues that I believe will be raised by the development and future commonplace adoption of mobile, wearable, augmented reality systems. These include: social influences on tracking accuracy, the importance of appearance and comfort, an increase in collaborative applications, integration with other devices, and implications for personal privacy.  1.

Rhodes [10] suggests five criteria for wearable systems: portable while operational, needing minimal manual input, sensitive to the user's surrounding environment, always on, and able to attract the user's attention even when not actively in use.
