ATLAS: A generic software platform for speech technology based applications ATLAS is a Java software library that provides a framework for building multilingual  and multi-modal applications, especially dialogue systems, on top of speech  technology components. The design is based on a layered system model, where  ATLAS sits as a middleware between an application-dependent layer and the  speech technology components and implements much of application-independent  functionality in the system. ATLAS is itself layered with interfaces to speech  technology components at the bottom and self-contained dialogue components at  the top. The layered design is both efficient and flexible and is suitable for a  research environment. The framework also provides support for applicationdependent  layers through a structure of an application with sessions interacting  with users through terminals. The terminal concept supports creating audio deviceindependent  applications that run transparently in both telephone and desktop  environments. Several speech technology components are available for use with  the ATLAS framework, including text-to-speech, speech recognition and speaker  verification systems. Four applications that use ATLAS have so far been developed  within student and research projects at the Centre for Speech Technology (CTT),  including a speech controlled telephone banking system (CTT-bank) and an  automated entrance receptionist (PER).  1.
