Case-Based Learning: Beyond Classification of Feature Vectors . The dominant theme of case-based research at recent ML conferences has been on classifying cases represented by feature vectors. However, other useful tasks can be targeted, and other representations are often preferable. We review the recent literature on case-based learning, focusing on alternative performance tasks and more expressive case representations. We also highlight topics in need of additional research. 1 Introduction  The majority of machine learning (ML) research has focussed on supervised learning tasks in which class-labeled cases, each represented as a vector of features, are given to a learning algorithm that induces a concept description. This description can then be used to predict the class labels of unlabeled cases. One approach for solving supervised learning tasks, called case-based,  3  involves storing cases, often as hproblem,solutioni pairs, and retrieving them to solve similar problems. This distinguishes their behavior from approaches that greedily repla...
