Multi-inference with Multi-neurules Neurules are a type of hybrid rules combining a symbolic and a connectionist representation. There are two disadvantages of neurules. The first is that the created neurule bases usually contain multiple representations of the same piece of knowledge. Also, the inference mechanism is rather connectionism oriented than symbolism oriented, thus reducing naturalness. To remedy these deficiencies, we introduce an extension to neurules, called multineurules, and an alternative inference process, which is rather symbolism oriented. Experimental results comparing the two inference processes are also presented.
