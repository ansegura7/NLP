Overlapping B+-trees: an Implementation of a Transaction Time Access Method A new variation of Overlapping B+-trees is presented, which provides efficient indexing of transaction time and keys in a two dimensional key-time space. Modification operations (i.e. insertions, deletions and updates) are allowed at the current version, whereas queries are allowed to any temporal version, i.e. either in the current or in past versions. Using this structure, snapshot and range-timeslice queries can be answered optimally. However, the fundamental objective of the proposed method is to deliver efficient performance in case of a general pure-key query (i.e. "history of a key"). The trade-off is a small increase in time cost for version operations and storage requirements.
