Practical Reasoning with Procedural Knowledge (A Logic of BDI Agents with Know-How) . In this paper, we present a new logic for specifying the behaviour of  multi-agent systems. In this logic, agents are viewed as BDI systems, in that their  state is characterised in terms of beliefs, desires, and intentions: the semantics  of the BDI component of the logic are based on the well-known system of Rao  and Georgeff. In addition, agents have available to them a library of plans, representing  their `know-how': procedural knowledge about how to achieve their intentions.  These plans are, in effect, programs, that specify how a group of agents  can work in parallel to achieve certain ends. The logic provides a rich set of constructs  for describing the structure and execution of plans. Some properties of the  logic are investigated, (in particular, those relating to plans), and some comments  on future work are presented.  1 Introduction  There is currently much international interest in computer systems that go under the banner of intelligent agents [16]. Crudely, an intel...
