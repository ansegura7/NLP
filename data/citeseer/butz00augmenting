Augmenting Buildings with Infrared Information We describe a building information and navigation system based on Palm Pilot PDAs and a set of strong infrared transmitters, located throughout a building. The infrared senders stream localized data, thus effectively augmenting areas of space with localized information. This information can be perceived by just entering those areas with the PDA in your hand. We show that this form of augmentation of an environment can serve a multitude of purposes and requires neither the employment of classic 3D augmented reality nor to carry around wearable computers nor to wear head mounted displays.  1 Introduction  The IRREAL system is a building information system that by its pure working principle can also be used as a navigation system within buildings. It is based on the Palm Pilot family of PDAs most of which feature a builtin infrared port located in the middle of the top end of the device, so that it points away from the user when the device is being held in front of the user. By using this...
