Contextualizing the Information Space in Federated Digital Libraries Rapid growth in the volume of documents, their diversity, and terminological variations render federated digital libraries increasingly difficult to manage. Suitable abstraction mechanisms are required to construct meaningful and scalable document clusters, forming a cross-digital library information space for browsing and semantic searching. This paper addresses the above issues, proposes a distributed semantic framework that achieves a logical partitioning of the information space according to topic areas, and provides facilities to contextualize and landscape the available document sets in subject-specific categories.
