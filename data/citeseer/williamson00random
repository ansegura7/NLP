Random Probability Functions Random probability functions are required in Monte Carlo simulations for expert systems testing. Here I give an empirical method for generating such functions. While this is a practical problem, its solution raises interesting philosophical questions. The design of expert systems is an important problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence. One task, for instance, is to give a general methodology for diagnosis which can be used to construct computer experts in a whole range of areas such as the diagnosis of hepatitis and fault-finding in circuit boards. Clearly before these artificial experts can be used to make critical decisions they must be thoroughly tested and their reliability ascertained. Two approaches to testing stand out: empirical experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. Empirical testing is certainly desirable, but there may not be enough empirical data readily available. To ascertain the reliability of a particular diagnostic expert system one often requires a considerab...
