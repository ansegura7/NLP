Query Processing in a Device Database System Data Types Today's object-relational and object-oriented databases support Abstract Data Type (ADT) objects that are single attribute values encapsulating a collection of related data. The critical feature of an ADT that makes it suitable for representing devices is encapsulation. % Note that there are natural parallels between devices and ADTs. Both ADTs and devices provide controlled access to encapsulated data and functionality through a well-defined interface. We build upon this observation by modeling each type of device in the network as an ADT in the database -- an actual ADT object in the database corresponds then to a physical device in the real world. The public interface of the ADT corresponds to the functionality supported by the device. Methods on the device are executed by sending requests to the device, which evaluates the methods and answers with return values. Differences between the different device types are reflected by differences between the abstract dat...
