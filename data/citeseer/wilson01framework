A Framework for Linking Distributed Simulations Using Software Agents This paper presents the basic ideas behind the use of software agent technology for distributed simulation and data assimilation. A software agent is an autonomous computer program that operates on behalf of someone or something. A mobile agent has the ability to migrate during execution from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network, while a stationary agent executes only on the system on which it began execution.
