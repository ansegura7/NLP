The Persistent Cache: Improving OID Indexing in Temporal Object-Oriented Database Systems In a temporal OODB, an OID index (OIDX) is needed to map from OID to the physical location of the object. In a transaction time temporal OODB, the OIDX should also index the object versions. In this case, the index entries, which we call object descriptors (OD), also include the commit timestamp of the transaction that created the object version. The OIDX in a non-temporal OODB only needs to be updated when an object is created, but in a temporal OODB, the OIDX have to be updated every time an object is updated. We have in a previous study shown that this can be a potential bottleneck, and in this report, we present the Persistent Cache (PCache), a novel approach which reduces the index update and lookup costs in temporal OODBs. In this report, we develop a cost model for the PCache, and use this to show that the use of a PCache can reduce the average access cost to only a fraction of the cost when not using the PCache. Even though the primary context of this report is OID indexing in ...
