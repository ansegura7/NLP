Side Constraints and Non-Price Attributes in Markets In most real-world (electronic) marketplaces, there  are other considerations besides maximizing immediate  economic value. We present a sound way  of taking such considerations into account via side  constraints and non-price attributes. Side constraints  have a significant impact on the complexity  of market clearing. Budget constraints, a limit on  the number of winners, and XOR-constraints make  even noncombinatorial markets ##-complete to  clear. The latter two make markets ##-complete  to clear even if bids can be accepted partially. This  is surprising since, as we show, even combinatorial  markets with a host of very similar side constraints  can be cleared in polytime. An extreme equality  constraint makes combinatorial markets polytime  clearable even if bids have to be accepted entirely  or not at all. Finally, we present a way to  take into account additional attributes using a bid  re-weighting scheme, and prove that it does not  change the complexity of clearing. All of the results  hold for auctions as well as exchanges, with  and without free disposal.  1
