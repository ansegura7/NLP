A Security Architecture for Application Session Handoff Ubiquitous computing across a variety of wired and wireless connections still lacks an effective security architecture. In our research work, we address the specific issue of designing and building a security architecture for Application Session Handoff, a functionality which we envision will be a key component enabling ubiquitous computing. Our architecture incorporates a number of proven approaches into the new context of ubiquitous computing. We employ the Bell-LaPadula and capability models to realise access control and adopt Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based approaches to provide efficient and authenticated end-to-end security. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our design, we implemented an application enabled with this security architecture and showed that it incurred low latency.
