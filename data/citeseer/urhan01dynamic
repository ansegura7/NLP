Dynamic Pipeline Scheduling for Improving Interactive Query Performance Interactive query performance is becoming an  important criterion for online systems where  delivering query results in a timely fashion  is critical. Pipelined execution is a promising  query execution style that can produce  the initial portion of the result early and in  a continuous fashion. In this paper we propose  techniques for delivering results faster in  a pipelined query plan. We distinguish between  two cases. For cases where the tuples  in the query result are of the same importance  we propose a dynamic rate-based  pipeline scheduling policy that produces more  results during the early stages of query execution.
