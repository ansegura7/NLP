OmniPage vs. Sakhr: Paired Model Evaluation of Two Arabic OCR Products Characterizing the performance of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems is crucial for monitoring technical progress, predicting OCR performance, providing scientific explanations for the system behavior and identifying open problems. While research has been done in the past to compare performances of two or more OCR systems, all assume that the accuracies achieved on individual documents in a dataset are independent when, in fact, they are not. In this paper we show that accuracies reported on any dataset are correlated and invoke the appropriate statistical technique --- the paired model --- to compare the accuracies of two recognition systems. Theoretically we show that this method provides tighter confidence intervals than methods used in OCR and computer vision literature. We also propose a new visualization method, which we call the accuracy scatter plot, for providing a visual summary of performance results. This method summarizes the accuracy comparisons on the entire cor...
