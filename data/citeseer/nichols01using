Using Handhelds as Controls for Everyday Appliances: A Paper Prototype Study Everyday appliances, including telephones, copiers, and home stereos, increasingly contain embedded computers which enable greater functionality. If the interfaces to these appliances were easy to use, people might benefit from these new functions. Unfortunately, it is rare to find a well-designed appliance interface.
