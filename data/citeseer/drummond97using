Using a Case Base of Surfaces to Speed-Up Reinforcement Learning . This paper demonstrates the exploitation of certain vision processing techniques to index into a case base of surfaces. The surfaces are the result of reinforcement learning and represent the optimum choice of actions to achieve some goal from anywhere in the state space. This paper shows how strong features that occur in the interaction of the system with its environment can be detected early in the learning process. Such features allow the system to identify when an identical, or very similar, task has been solved previously and to retrieve the relevant surface. This results in an orders of magnitude increase in learning rate. 1 Introduction  One important research issue for case based learning is its combination with other learning methods. As Aamodt and Plaza [1] point out, generally the machine learning community aims to produce "a coherent framework, where each learning method fulfills a specific and distinct role in the system." This paper discusses one such approach, combinin...
