Toward Generalized Organizationally Contexted Agent Control Generalized domain-independent approaches to agent control enable control components to be used for a wide variety of applications. This abstraction from the domain context implies that contextual behavior is not possible or that it requires violation of the domain-independent objective. We discuss how context is used in the generalized framework and our current focus on the addition of organizational context in agent control. 1 Introduction  From the vantage point of a long history of research in agents and agent control components for building distributed AI and multi-agent systems, we have focused our recent efforts on approaching agent control from a generalized domainindependent perspective. In implementation terms, the objective is to develop a set of agent control components that can be bundled with domain problem solvers or legacy applications to create agents that can meet real-time deadlines (and real-resource constraints) and coordinate activities with other agents. This pap...
