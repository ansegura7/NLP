Market Clearability Market mechanisms play a central role in AI as a  coordination tool in multiagent systems and as an  application area for algorithm design. Mechanisms  where buyers are directly cleared with sellers, and  thus do not require an external liquidity provider,  are highly desirable for electronic marketplaces for  several reasons. In this paper we study the inherent  complexity of, and design algorithms for, clearing  auctions and reverse auctions with multiple indistinguishable  units for sale. We consider settings  where bidders express their preferences via  price-quantity curves, and settings where the bids  are price-quantity pairs. We show that markets  with piecewise linear supply/demand curves and  non-discriminatory pricing can always be cleared  in polynomial time. Surprisingly, if discriminatory  pricing is used to clear the market, the problem  becomes NP-Complete (even for step function  curves). If the price-quantity curves are all  linear, then, in most variants, the problem admits  a poly-time solution even for discriminatory pricing.  When bidders express their preferences with  price-quantity pairs, the problem is NP-Complete,  but solvable in pseudo-polynomial time. With free  disposal, the problem admits a poly-time approximation  scheme, but no such approximation scheme  is possible without free disposal. We also present  pseudo-polynomial algorithms for XOR bids and  or-of-xors bids, and analyze the approximability.  1
