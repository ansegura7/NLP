Similarity Measures With complex multimedia data, we see the emergence of database systems in which the fundamental operation is similarity assessment. Before database issues can be addressed, it is necessary to give a definition of similarity as an operation. In this paper we develop a similarity measure, based on fuzzy logic, that exhibit several features that match experimental findings in humans. The model is dubbed Fuzzy Feature Contrast (FFC) and is an extension to a more general domain of the Feature Contrast model due to Tversky. We show how the FFC model can be used to model similarity assessment from fuzzy judgment of properties, and we address the use of fuzzy measures to deal with dependencies among the properties. 1 Introduction  Comparing two images, or an image and a model, is the fundamental operation for many Visual Information Retrieval systems. In most systems of interest, a simple pixel-by-pixel comparison won't do: the difference that we determine must bear some correlation with the p...
