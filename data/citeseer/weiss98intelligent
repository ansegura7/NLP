Intelligent Telecommunication Technologies anage telecommunication networks. Building such applications involved acquiring valuable telecommunication knowledge from human experts and then applying this knowledge, typically by embedding it in an expert system. This knowledge acquisition process is so time-consuming that it is referred to as the "knowledge acquisition bottleneck". Data mining techniques are now being applied to industrial applications to break this bottleneck, by replacing the manual knowledge acquisition process with automated knowledge discovery. Telecommunication networks, which routinely generate tremendous amounts of data, are ideal candidates for data mining [1]. This section will describe expert system and data mining technologies and how they are evolving to solve complex industrial problems. 1.1 Expert Systems Expert systems are programs which represent and apply factual knowledge of specific areas of expertise to solve problems [2]. Expert systems have been applied extensively within
