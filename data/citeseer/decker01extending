Extending a Multi-Agent System for Genomic Annotation . The explosive growth in genomic (and soon, expression and proteomic)  data, exemplified by the Human Genome Project, is a fertile domain for the application  of multi-agent information gathering technologies. Furthermore, hundreds  of smaller-profile, yet still economically important organisms are being studied  that require the efficient and inexpensive automated analysis tools that multiagent  approaches can provide. In this paper we give a progress report on the use  of the DECAF multi-agent toolkit to build reusable information gathering systems  for bioinformatics. We will briefly summarize why bioinformatics is a classic  application for information gathering, how DECAF supports it, and recent  extensions underway to support new analysis paths for genomic information.  1
