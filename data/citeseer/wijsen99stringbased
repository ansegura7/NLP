A String-based Model for Infinite Granularities (Extended Abstract) )  Jef Wijsen  Universit'e de Mons-Hainaut  Jef.Wijsen@umh.ac.be  Abstract  In the last few years, the concept of time granularity  has been defined by several researchers, and a glossary  of time granularity concepts has been published. These  definitions often view a time granularity as a (mostly  infinite) sequence of time granules. Although this view  is conceptually clean, it is extremely inefficient or even  practically impossible to represent a time granularity  in this manner. In this paper, we present a practical  formalism for the finite representation of infinite granularities.  The formalism is string-based, allows symbolic  reasoning, and can be extended to multiple dimensions  to accommodate, for example, space.  Introduction  In the last few years, formalisms to represent and to reason about temporal and spatial granularity have been developed in several areas of computer science. Although several researchers have used different definitions of time granularity, they comm...
