Effective Resource Discovery on the World Wide Web this paper, we present USEwebNET, a resource discovery tool built on top of traditional search engines. USEwebNET registers each user's interests and repeatedly queries several search engines for URLs matching a user's registered interests. USEwebNET keeps track of which URLs have been visited by each user. Thus, when a user invokes USEwebNET, (s)he is presented only with new or "unvisited" URLs. We view USEwebNET as a value-added service on top of existing search engines and information providers, which helps users effectively find "what's new" in the rapidly evolving web of our world.
