The BASIS System: a Benchmarking Approach for Spatial Index Structures This paper describes the design of the BASIS prototype system, which is currently under implementation. BASIS stands for Benchmarking Approach for Spatial Index Structures. It is a prototype system aiming at performance evaluation of spatial access methods and query processing strategies, under different data sets, various query types, and different workloads. BASIS is based on a modular architecture, composed of a simple storage manager, a query processor, and a set of algorithmic techniques to facilitate benchmarking. The main objective of BASIS is twofold: (i) to provide a benchmarking environment for spatial access methods and related query evaluation techniques, and (ii) to allow comparative studies of spatial access methods in different cases but under a common framework. We currently extend it to support the fundamental features of spatiotemporal data management and access methods.
