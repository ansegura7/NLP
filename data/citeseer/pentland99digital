The Digital Doctor: An Experiment in Wearable Telemedicine Consultation with various specialists and review of medical literature are key elements in superior, modern medical care. Because this information can be expensive and inconvenient to access, physicians and patients must typically compromise ideal care practices with practical realities. Awearable computer with the ability to transmit and receive text and image data without a direct connection during an examination can remove the need for such compromise, potentially allowing both better care and lower cost. In this paper we report on experiments conducted at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital in which a wearable computer is usedtocreate patient records and provide remote consultations during dermatological examinations.
