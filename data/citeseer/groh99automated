Automated Knowledge and Information Fusion from multiple text-based sources using Formal Concept Analysis This report explores the space of this problem and develops some steps towards its solutions. Our experience with knowledge representation languages and dynamic hyperlinking of HTML documents using conceptual graphs seems complementary to the multiple source knowledge fusion task [40]. The reasons are that conceptual graphs are based on lexical, hierarchically structured ontologies of semantically related terms and these structures lend themselves to traditional information retrival engines, at least so far as term extraction from text is concerned. Furthermore, conceptual graphs provide for typical and necessary conditions, logical inference and term signatures that aid with disambiguiation of semantic intent. Conceptual graphs also permit knowledge fusion by way of the maximal join operation. Conceptual graphs are not without their research challenges however. Who or what can automatically generate the CGs and how the approach scales to real-world  multiple source fusion are open questions. To address the first of these issues. There are two schools of thought on who or what generates the CGs needed for knowledge fusion from multiple sources. The first of these is that index expressions generated by a meta-level information retrival engine called the Hyperindex Browser (the HiB) [5, 6, 7, 4] can be used to automatically generate knowledge annotations as input to an inference engine (such as the one used by our research group's WebKB software [38, 39, 40]). The idea here is that we can efficiently extract and fuse knowledge structures from example documents to construct a knowledge exemplar and that these exemplars are subsequently used to compute the closure of the knowledge base and generate pattern recognition classifiers (see Figure 1.1).
