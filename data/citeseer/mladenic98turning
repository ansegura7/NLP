Turning Yahoo into an Automatic Web-Page Classifier . The paper describes an approach to automatic Web-page classification based on the Yahoo hierarchy. Machine learning techniques developed for learning on text data are used here on the hierarchical classification structure. The high number of features is reduced by taking into account the hierarchical structure and using feature subset selection based on the method known from information retrieval. Documents are represented as feature-vectors that include n-grams instead of including only single words (unigrams) as commonly used when learning on text data. Based on the hierarchical structure the problem is divided into subproblems, each representing one on the categories included in the Yahoo hierarchy. The result of learning is a set of independent classifiers, each used to predict the probability that a new example is a member of the corresponding category. Experimental evaluation on real-world data shows that the proposed approach gives good results. For more than a half of testing...
