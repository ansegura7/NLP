Jacob project - Documentation The Jacob software system has been built as part of the Jacob project, which is a pilot project of the Virtual Reality Valley Twente initiative. The Jacob project investigates the application of virtual reality techniques and involves the design and construction of an animated agent in a 3-dimensional virtual environment. The project focuses on software engineering aspects, multimodal interaction, and the use of agent technology. In the current version of the Jacob system, an agent called Jacob teaches the user the Towers of Hanoi game; interaction takes place through natural language and manipulations of objects in the virtual environment. The purpose of this report is to provide information needed for further development of the Jacob system. It describes a number of technical details, including the file and directory structure, the software architecture, the event handling mechanism, and the integration of the dialogue management system.  3  Table of Contents 1 Introduction ...........
