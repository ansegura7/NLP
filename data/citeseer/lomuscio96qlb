QLB: A Quantified Logic for Belief . This paper describes QLB, a quantified logic of belief that is a possible extension of the modal system KD45n to predicate level. The main features of QLB are that: (i) it is allowed to quantify over the agents of belief; (ii) the belief operator can be indexed by any term of the formal language; (iii) terms are not rigid designators, but are interpreted contextually; (iv) automatic theorem proving is possible in QLB (but it is not presented in this paper). QLB is constructed as a partial logic with a monotonic semantics on ordered sets, and its semantic theorems are defined as the formulae that are sometimes true and never false. 1 Introduction  Agents are complex objects: they can be modelled in terms of mental states, like knowledge, beliefs, intentions, goals, plans, etc. and they perform actions (sometimes cooperatively) in a society of other agents. In this book the reader can find contributions from different schools of thought related to agents: agent theories for specificati...
