The Shape of the Web and Its Implications for Searching the Web With the rapid growth of the number of web pages, designing a search engine that can retrieve high quality information in response to a user query is a challenging task. Automated search engines that rely on keyword matching usually return too many low quality matches and they take a long time to run. It is argued in the literature that link-following search methods can substantially increase the search quality, provided that these methods use an accurate assumption about useful patterns in the hyperlink topology of the web. Recent work in the field has focused on detecting identi able patterns in the web graph and exploiting this information to improve the performance of search algorithms. We survey relevant work in this area and comment on the implications of these patterns for other areas such as advertisement and marketing.
