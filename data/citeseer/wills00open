An Open Software Infrastructure For Reconfigurable Control Systems Recent advances in software technology have the potential to revolutionize control system design. This paper describes a new software infrastructure for complex control systems, which exploits new and emerging software technologies. It presents an open control platform (OCP) for complex systems, including those that must be reconfigured or customized in real-time for  extreme-performance applications. An application of the OCP to the control system design of an autonomous aerial vehicle is described.  1 Introduction  Complex dynamic systems, such as aircraft, power  systems, and telecommunications networks, present major  challenges to control systems designers. Both the military and civilian sectors of our economy are demanding new and highly sophisticated capabilities from these systems that the current state-of-the-art is not offering. Among them are the following:  . Ability to adapt to a changing environment;  . Ability to reconfigure the control algorithms;  . Plug-and-play exten...
