CaseLP, A Rapid Prototyping Environment For Agent Based Software Intelligent agents and multi-agent systems are increasingly recognized as an innovative approach for analyzing, designing and implementing complex, heterogeneous and distributed software applications. The agent-based view offers a powerful and high level conceptualization that software engineers can exploit to considerably improve the way in which software is realized. Agent-based software engineering is a recent and very interesting research area. Due to its novelty, there is still no evidence of well-established practices for the development of agent-based applications and thus experimentation in this direction is very important.
