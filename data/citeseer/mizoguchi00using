Using Ontological Engineering to Overcome Common AI-ED Problems This paper discusses long-term prospects of AI-ED research with the aim of giving a clear view of what we need for further promotion of the research from both the AI and ED points of view. An analysis of the current status of AI-ED research is done in the light of intelligence, conceptualization, standardization and theory-awareness. Following this, an ontology-based architecture with appropriate ontologies is proposed. Ontological engineering of IS/ID is next discussed followed by a road map towards an ontology-aware authoring system. Heuristic design patterns and XML-based documentation are also discussed.  1. INTRODUCTION  Among AI-ED research done to date, several paradigms such as CAI, ICAI, Micro-world, ITS, ILE, and CSCL have been proposed and many systems have been built within each paradigm. Additionally, innovative computer technologies such as hyper-media, virtual reality, internet, WWW have significantly affected the AI-ED community in general. We really have learned a lot ...
