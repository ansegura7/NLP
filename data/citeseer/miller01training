Training for Teamwork Teams train by practicing basic interaction skills in order to develop a shared mental model between team members. A computer-based training system must have a model of teamwork to train a new team member to act as part of a team. This model of teamwork can be used to identify weaknesses in team interaction skills in the trainee. Existing multi-agent models for teamwork are limited in their ability to support proactive information exchange among teammates. To address this issue, we have developed and implemented a multi-agent architecture called CAST that simulates teamwork and supports proactive information exchange in a dynamic environment. To this we are adding a tutoring system that monitors, evaluates, and corrects the trainee in the performance of teamwork skills.  Keywords: ITS, teamwork, multi-agent, collaboration, HCI
