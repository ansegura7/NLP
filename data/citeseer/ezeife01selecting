Selecting and Materializing Horizontally Partitioned Warehouse Views Data warehouse views typically store large aggregate tables based on a subset of dimension attributes of the main data warehouse fact table. Aggregate views can be stored as 2  n  subviews of a data cube with n attributes. Methods have been proposed for selecting only some of the data cube views to materialize in order to speed up query response time, accommodate storage space constraint and reduce warehouse maintenance cost. This paper proposes a method for selecting and materializing views, which selects and horizontally fragments a view, recomputes the size of the stored partitioned view while deciding further views to select. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
