The Adaptive Agent Architecture: Achieving Fault-Tolerance Using Persistent Broker Teams Brokers are used in many multi-agent systems for locating agents, for routing and sharing  information, for managing the system, and for legal purposes, as independent third parties.  However, these multi-agent systems can be incapacitated and rendered non-functional when the  brokers become inaccessible due to failures such as machine crashes, network breakdowns, and  process failures that can occur in any distributed software system.  We propose that the theory of teamwork can be used to create robust brokered architectures that  can recover from broker failures, and we present the Adaptive Agent Architecture (AAA) to show  the feasibility of this approach. The AAA brokers form a team with a joint commitment to serve  any agent that registers with the broker team as long as the agent remains registered with the  team. This commitment enables the brokers to substitute for each other when needed. A multiagent  system based on the AAA can continue to work despite broker failures as long...
