Temporal Requirements for Anticipatory Reasoning about Intentional Dynamics in Social Contexts Abstract In this paper a temporal trace language is defined in which formulae can be expressed that provide an external temporal grounding of intentional notions. Justifying conditions are presented that formalise criteria that a (candidate) formula must satisfy in order to qualify as an external representation of a belief, desire or intention. Using these conditions, external represenation formulae for intentional notions can be identified. Using these external representations, anticipatory reasoning about intentional dynamics can be performed. 1
