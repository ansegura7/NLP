Cryptographic Traces for Mobile Agents . Mobile code systems are technologies that allow applications  to move their code, and possibly the corresponding state, among the  nodes of a wide-area network. Code mobility is a flexible and powerful  mechanism that can be exploited to build distributed applications  in an Internet scale. At the same time, the ability to move code to and  from remote hosts introduces serious security issues. These issues include  authentication of the parties involved and protection of the hosts from  malicious code. However, the most difficult task is to protect mobile  code against attacks coming from hosts. This paper presents a mechanism  based on execution tracing and cryptography that allows one to  detect attacks against code, state, and execution flow of mobile software  components.  1 Introduction  Mobile code technologies are languages and systems that exploit some form of code mobility in an Internet-scale setting. In this framework, the network is populated by several loosely coupled co...
