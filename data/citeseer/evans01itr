ITR: A Framework for Environment-Aware, Massively Distributed Computing physical environment in real-time, and the need to reason about emerging aggregate properties as opposed to individual component behavior. In this research we propose to develop theory, methods and tools for massively distributed, environment-aware computing (more succinctly referred to as swarm computing).  The state of swarm computing today is similar to that of sequential computing in the early 1950s. Developers painstakingly produce swarm programs by designing and programming the actions of individual devices, and converge on an acceptable program through extensive simulation and experimentation. In the pre-compiler era, skeptical programmers believed that a mechanical process could not possibly produce code of comparable quality to that produced by highly skilled machine coders and that the cost of machine time is high enough to outweigh any possible savings in programmer effort. The state of swarm programming today is similar: devices are still expensive enough an
