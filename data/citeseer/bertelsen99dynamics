Dynamics in Wastewater Treatment: A Framework for Understanding Formal Constructs in Complex Technical Settings . Based on the study of unskilled work in a Danish wastewater treatment plant, the problem of formalisation of work is discussed and extended to technical processes. Five symmetrical levels of dynamics in complex technical work arrangements are proposed as a tool for understanding the limits of formalisation and for designing formal constructs in such settings. The analysis is based on concepts of heterogeneity, granularity of goals and motives, and process and structure.  Introduction  An inevitable problem in the design of CSCW systems is that work is not standing still. Rather, work settings are dynamic: routines evolve over time and unusual situations force deviations from the routine. For this reason, purely formal constructs and descriptions of work have proven inadequate when designing effective, real world CSCW systems.  Suchman and Wynn (1984) set off the debate about the role of formalism in CSCW, and their empirical studies clearly illustrated that there is more to office wo...
