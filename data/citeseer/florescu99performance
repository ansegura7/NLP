A Performance Evaluation of Alternative Mapping Schemes for Storing XML Data in a Relational Database XML is emerging as one of the dominant data formats for data processing on the Internet. To query  XML data, query languages likeXQL, Lorel, XML-QL, or XML-GL have been proposed. In this paper,  we study how XML data can be stored and queried using a standard relational database system. For this  purpose, we present alternative mapping schemes to store XML data in a relational database and discuss  how XML-QL queries can be translated into SQL queries for every mapping scheme. We present the  results of comprehensive performance experiments that analyze the tradeo#s of the alternative mapping  schemes in terms of database size, query performance and update performance. While our discussion  is focussed on XML and XML-QL, the results of this paper are relevant for most semi-structured data  models and most query languages for semi-structured data.  1 Introduction  It has become clear that not all applications are met by the relational, object-relational, or object-oriented data models. ...
