Dynamic Update Cube for Range-Sum Queries A range-sum query is very popular and becomes  important in finding trends and in discovering  relationships between attributes in diverse  database applications. It sums over the selected  cells of an OLAP data cube where target cells are  decided by the specified query ranges. The direct  method to access the data cube itself forces too  many cells to be accessed, therefore it incurs a  severe overhead. The response time is very  crucial for OLAP applications which need  interactions with users. In the recent dynamic  enterprise environment, data elements in the  cube are frequently changed. The response time  is affected in such an environment by the update  cost as well as the search cost of the cube.  In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm  to reduce the update cost significantly while  maintaining reasonable search efficiency, by  using an index structure called the -tree. In  addition, we propose a hybrid method to provide  either an approximate result or a precise one to  reduce the overall cost of queries. It is useful for  various applications that need a quick approximate  answer rather than an accurate one, such as  decision support systems.  1.
