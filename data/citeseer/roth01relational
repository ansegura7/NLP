Relational Learning via Propositional Algorithms: An Information Extraction Case Study This paper develops a new paradigm for relational  learning which allows for the representation and  learning of relational information using propositional  means. This paradigm suggests different  tradeoffs than those in the traditional approach to  this problem -- the ILP approach -- and as a result  it enjoys several significant advantages over it. In  particular, the new paradigm is more flexible and  allows the use of any propositional algorithm, including  probabilistic algorithms, within it.  We evaluate the new approach on an important  and relation-intensive task - Information Extraction  - and show that it outperforms existing methods  while being orders of magnitude more efficient.  1
