SI-Designer: a tool for intelligent integration of information SI-Designer (Source Integrator Designer) is a designer support tool for semi ??? automatic integration of heterogeneous sources schemata (relational, object and semi ??? structured sources); it has been implemented within the MOMIS project and it carries out integration following a semantic approach which uses intelligent Description Logics-based techniques, clustering techniques and an extended ODMG-ODL language, ???????????????????????? ??? , to represent schemata, extracted, integrated information. Starting from the sources ??? ???????????????????????? ??? descriptions (local schemata) SI-Designer supports the designer in the creation of an integrated view of all the sources (global schema) which is expressed in the same ???????????????????????? ??? language. We propose SI-Designer as a tool to build virtual catalogs in the E-Commerce environment. 1.
