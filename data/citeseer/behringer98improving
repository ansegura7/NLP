Improving the Registration Precision by Visual Horizon Silhouette Matching A system for enhancing the situational awareness in an outdoor  scenario by Augmented Reality (AR) techniques can utilize visual  clues for improving registration precision. If visible, terrain silhouettes  provide unique features to be matched with digital elevation  map (DEM) data. The best match of a visually extracted silhouette  with the DEM silhouette provides camera/observer orientation (elevation  and azimuth). We have developed such a registration system  which runs on a PC (200 MHz) and is being ported to a wearable  AR system.  1 Introduction and Context  1.1 Augmented Reality  In the past years, augmented reality (AR) has gained significant attention due to rapid progress in several key areas (wearable computing, virtual reality rendering)[2]. AR technology provides means of intuitive information presentation for enhancing the situational awareness and perception by exploiting the natural and familiar human interaction modalities with the environment.
