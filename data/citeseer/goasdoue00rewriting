Rewriting Conjunctive Queries Using Views in Description Logics with Existential Restrictions this paper, extending the work of [8], we study the problem of rewriting conjunctive queries over DL expressions into conjunctive queries using a set of views that are a set of distinguished DL expressions, for three DLs allowing existential restrictions: FLE , ALE and ALNE . Thus, our rewriting problem is: given a conjunctive query over expressions from a DL L 2 fFLE;ALE ; ALNEg and a set of views V over expressions from L, we want to compute a representative set of all the rewritings of the query that are conjunctive queries over V. By representative set we mean that this set contains at least the rewritings that are maximally contained in the query.
