A Description Logic for Vague Knowledge This work introduces the concept language ALCFM which is an extension of ALC to many-valued logics. ALCFM allows to express vague concepts, e.g. more or less enlarged or very small. To realize this extension to many-valued logics, the classical notions of satisfiability and subsumption had to be modified appropriately. For example, ALCFM -concepts are no longer either satisfiable or unsatisfiable, but they are satisfiable to a certain degree. The main contribution of this paper is a sound and complete method for computing the degree of subsumption between two  ALCFM -concepts. 1 Introduction  This work takes its motivation from the occurrence of vague concept descriptions in different application areas. Often, application--inherent information is characterized by a very high degree of vagueness. Appropriate information systems must be able to process this kind of data. So far, there are no systems that really solve the corresponding problems due to the lack of powerful basic methods. A...
