Towards Transparent Control of Large and Complex Systems System Identi cation. Unlike with Markovian Decision Processes, some systems' output depends not only on the current state, but also the previous input/output. As a training data set for nonlinear system identi cation, the Box-Jenkins gas furnace data [BJ70] is often studied and compared. The furnace input is the gas ow rate x(t), the output y(t) is the CO 2 concentration. At least 10 candidate inputs are considered: x(t 6); x(t 5); : : : ; x(t 1); y(t 1); : : : ; y(t 4). If all of them are used, building a fuzzy controller means to solve a 10-input-1-output problem. If each input is de ned by 5 linguistic terms, this would result in a fuzzy rule system of about 10 million rules. The modelling and prediction o
