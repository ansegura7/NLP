View-Based 3d Object Recognition With Support Vector Machines . Support Vector Machines have demonstrated excellent results in pattern recognition tasks and 3D object recognition. In this contribution, we confirm some of the results in 3D object recognition and compare it to other object recognition systems. We use di#erent pixel-level representations to perform the experiments, while we extend the setting to the more challenging and practical case when only a limited number of views of the object are presented during training. We report high correct classification of unseen views, especially considering that no domain knowledge is including into the proposed system. Finally, we suggest an active learning algorithm to reduce further the required number of training views. INTRODUCTION  Humans are able to recognize everyday 3D objects when shown previously only one - or at most a few - views of the object. In contrast, artificial systems must either been shown many views of an object (e.g. [8]) or either a lot of knowledge of object structure must ...
