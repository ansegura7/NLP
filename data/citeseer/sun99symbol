Symbol Grounding: A New Look At An Old Idea Symbols should be grounded, as has been argued before. But we insist that they should be  grounded not only in subsymbolic activities, but also in the interaction between the agent and the  world. The point is that concepts are not formed in isolation (from the world), in abstraction, or  \objectively". They are formed in relation to the experience of agents, through their perceptual  /motor apparatuses, in their world and linked to their goals and actions.  In this paper, we will take a detailed look at this relatively old issue, using a new perspective,  aided by our new work of computational cognitive model development. To further our understanding,  we also go back in time to link up with earlier philosophical theories related to this issue. The  result is an account that extends from computational mechanisms to philosophical abstractions.  1  Symbol Grounding: A New Look At An Old Idea  Symbols should be grounded, as has been argued before.
