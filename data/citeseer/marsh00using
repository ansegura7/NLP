Using Cinematography Conventions to Inform Guidelines For the Design and Evaluation of Virtual Off-Screen Space Many usability problems are associated with navigation and exploration of virtual space. In an attempt to find methods that support navigation within virtual space, this paper describes an investigation of cinematography conventions. In particular, this will focus on conventions that suggest to spectators the existence of additional space other than that contained within the confines or borders of the projection screen. Referred to as off-screen space, this paper builds upon these conventions and proposes guidelines to inform the design of visual cues to suggest virtual off-screen space. Visual cues will appear natural and transparent, they will help to guide participants through the smooth and continuously animated VE, and thus, maintain the illusion of interacting within a larger 3D virtual space than that contained within the restricted Field-Of-View (FOV) of the display screen. Introduction The 3 rd dimension of a Virtual Environment (VE) creates a space. Within ...
