Generating and Using State Spaces of Object-Oriented Petri Nets : The article discusses the notion of state spaces of object-oriented Petri nets associated to the tool called PNtalk and the role of identifiers of dynamically appearing and disappearing instances within these state spaces. Methods of working with identifiers based on sophisticated naming rules and mechanisms for abstracting names are described and compared. Some optimizations of state space generating algorithms for the context of object-oriented Petri nets are briefly mentioned, as well.  Key Words: Petri nets, object-orientation, state spaces, formal analysis and verification 1 Introduction  Methods of formal analysis and verification has been developed as an alternative to simulation approaches of examining properties of complex systems. Although we are not always able to fully verify the behaviour of a system, even partial analysis or verification can reveal some errors which tend to be different from the ones found by simulation due to the different nature of formal analysis and...
