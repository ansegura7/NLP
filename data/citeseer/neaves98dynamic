Dynamic Connection of Wearable Computers to Companion Devices Using Near-Field Radio Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Bristol and the University of Bristol Department of Computer Science are engaged in an initiative to explore the design, technology and use of wearable computers.  We describe a way of connecting a wearable computer to companion devices such as displays or cameras using near-field radio technology. The shortrange nature of near-field radio allows relatively high data rates (300 kbps -- 1Mbit), low power consumption and the interpretation of gestures as configuration requests.  Keywords: Near-field radio, dynamic connectivity.  INTRODUCTION  We are particularly interested in communication technologies that exhibit low-power, short range (up to 1 foot) and modest data rates (300 kbps -- 1 Mbs). The action of picking up a companion device (such as a display) establishes the communication link due to the very short range. An important aspect of a suitable communication technology is that the user is not required to touch an electrode and therefore handling of ...
