Constructing and Transforming CBR Implementations: Techniques for Corporate Memory Management Achieving widespread case-based reasoning support for corporate memories will require the flexibility to integrate implementations with existing organizational resources and infrastructure. Case-based reasoning implementations as currently constructed tend to fall into three categories, characterized by implementation constraints: task-based (task constraints alone), enterprise (integrating databases), and web-based (integrating web representations) . These implementation types represent the possible targets in constructing corporate memory systems, and it is important to understand the strengths of each, how they are built, and how one may be constructed by transforming another. This paper describes a framework that relates the three types of CBR implementation, discusses their typical strengths and weaknesses, and describes practical strategies for building corporate CBR memories to meet new requirements by transforming and synthesizing existing resources.  1 Introduction  Constructi...
