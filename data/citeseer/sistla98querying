Querying the Uncertain Position of Moving Objects In this paper we propose a data model for representing moving objects with uncertain positions in database systems. It is called the Moving Objects Spatio-Temporal (MOST) data model. We also propose Future Temporal Logic (FTL) as the query language for the MOST model, and devise an algorithm for processing FTL queries in MOST. 1 Introduction  Existing database management systems (DBMS's) are not well equipped to handle continuously changing data, such as the position of moving objects. The reason for this is that in databases, data is assumed to be constant unless it is explicitly modified. For example, if the salary field is 30K, then this salary is assumed to hold (i.e. 30K is returned in response to queries) until explicitly updated. Thus, in order to represent moving objects (e.g. cars) in a database, and answer queries about their position (e.g., How far is the car with license plate RWW860 from the nearest hospital?) the car's position has to be continuously updated. This is unsa...
