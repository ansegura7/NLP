Monitoring Network Logs for Anomalous Activity We report on the progress of the VenusDB active-database system as driven by WatchDog, an application in network intrusion detection. The application is typical of a class of problems we coin monotonic log monitoring systems. These are systems where real-time data sources are logged to a database for transactional assurances and the database further provides services for decision support. Milestones comprise the successful layering of a Venus language executable with Oracle through the use of the Venus Abstract Machine Interface (AMI, a data abstraction interface) and Oracle's native trigger mechanism. The identification of monotonic-logging systems as an interesting application class enables us to limit coupling modes and to identify an effective layered architecture.
