Multi-scale EM-ICP: A Fast and Robust Approach for Surface Registration We investigate in this article the rigid registration of large sets of points, generally sampled from surfaces. We formulate this problem as a general Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimation of the transformation and the matches. We show that, in the specific case of a Gaussian noise, it corresponds to the Iterative Closest Point algorithm (ICP) with the Mahalanobis distance.
