Tractable Query Answering in Indefinite Constraint Databases: Basic Results and Applications to Querying Spatiotemporal Information . We consider the scheme of indefinite constraint databases  proposed by Koubarakis. This scheme can be used to represent indefinite  information arising in temporal, spatial and truly spatiotemporal  applications. The main technical problem that we address in this paper is  the discovery of tractable classes of databases and queries in this scheme.  We start with the assumption that we have a class of constraints C with  satisfiability and variable elimination problems that can be solved in  PTIME. Under this assumption, we show that there are several general  classes of databases and queries for which query evaluation can be done  with PTIME data complexity. We then search for tractable instances of  C in the area of temporal and spatial constraints. Classes of constraints  with tractable satisfiability problems can be easily found in the literature.  The largest class that we consider is the class of Horn disjunctive  linear constraints over the rationals. Because variable eliminati...
