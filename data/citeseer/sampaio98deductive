Deductive Queries in ODMG Databases: the DOQL Approach The Deductive Object Query Language (DOQL) is a rule-based query  language designed to provide recursion, aggregates, grouping and virtual  collections in the context of an ODMG compliant object database system.  This paper provides a description of the constructs supported by DOQL  and the algebraic operational semantics induced by DOQL's query translation  approach to implementation. The translation consists of a logical  rewriting step used to normalise DOQL expressions into molecular forms,  and a mapping step that transforms the canonical molecular form into  algebraic expressions. The paper thus not only describes a deductive  language for use with ODMG databases, but indicates how this language  can be implemented using conventional query processing techniques.  1 Introduction  The ODMG standard is an important step forward due to the provision of a reference architecture for object databases. This architecture encompasses an object model and type system, a set of imperative lan...
