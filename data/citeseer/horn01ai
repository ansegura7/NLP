AI in Medicine on its way from knowledge-intensive to data-intensive systems The last 20 years of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence in medicine show a path from knowledge-intensive systems, which try to capture the essential knowledge of experts in a knowledge-based system, to data-intensive systems available today. Nowadays enormous amounts of information is accessible electronically. Large data sets are collected continuously monitoring physiological parameters of patients. Knowledgebased  systems are needed to make use of all these data available and to help us to cope with the information explosion. In addition, temporal data analysis and intelligent information visualization can help us to get a summarized view of the change over time of clinical parameters. Integrating AIM modules into the daily-routine software environment of our care providers gives us a great chance for maintaining and improving quality of care.  1 AIM: a partial view of its scope and potential  This paper gives a personalized view of research and develop...
