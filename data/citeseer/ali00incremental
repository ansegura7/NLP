Incremental Maintenance of Materialized OQL Views The importance of materialized views has grown significantly with the advent of data warehousing and OLAP technology. This increases the relevance of solutions to the problem of incrementally maintaining materialized views. So far, most work on this problem has been confined to relational settings. Proposals that apply to object databases have either used non-standard models or fallen short of providing a comprehensive framework. This paper contributes a solution to the incremental view maintenance problem for a large class of views expressed in OQL, the query language of the ODMG standard for object databases. The solution applies to immediate update propagation, and works for any update operation on views de ned over a substantial subset of ODMG types. The approach presented has been fully implemented and preliminary performance results are reported.
