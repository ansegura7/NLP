Automatically Analyzing and Organizing Music Archives . We are experiencing a tremendous increase in the amount of  music being made available in digital form. With the creation of large multimedia  collections, however, we need to devise ways to make those collections  accessible to the users. While music repositories exist today, they mostly  limit access to their content to query-based retrieval of their items based on  textual meta-information, with some advanced systems supporting acoustic  queries. What we would like to have additionally, is a way to facilitate exploration  of musical libraries. We thus need to automatically organize music  according to its sound characteristics in such a way that we nd similar  pieces of music grouped together, allowing us to nd a classical section, or  a hard-rock section etc. in a music repository.  In this paper we present an approach to obtain such an organization of  music data based on an extension to our SOMLib digital library system  for text documents. Particularly, we employ the Self-Organizing Map to  create a map of a musical archive, where pieces of music with similar sound  characteristics are organized next to each other on the two-dimensional map  display. Locating a piece of music on the map then leaves you with related  music next to it, allowing intuitive exploration of a music archive.
