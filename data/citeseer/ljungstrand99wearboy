The WearBoy: A Platform for Low-cost Public Wearable Devices We introduce the WearBoy -- a wearable, modified Nintendo GameBoy -- as a platform for exploring public wearable devices. We have minimized a Color GameBoy to enable users to comfortably wear it, making the device not much larger than the actual screen. Technical properties of the WearBoy are discussed, along with two applications using the platform. 1. Introduction Currently, many wearable computing prototypes are rather clumsy and heavy to wear, and often rely on several different electronic devices connected together by cables hidden in the user's clothing. This might be necessary for computationally demanding applications, but in many cases the application does not need much computational power, especially not if wireless access to more powerful resources is available. Several such low-end wearable platforms have been built and tested, e.g. the Thinking Tags [1]. These prototypes are usually custom designed around a small microcontroller with some additional features, but commonl...
