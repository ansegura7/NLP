Planning in Interplanetary Space: Theory and Practice On May 17th 1999, NASA activated for the first time  an AI-based planner/scheduler running on the flight  processor of a spacecraft. This was part of the Remote  Agent Experiment (RAX), a demonstration of closedloop  planning and execution, and model-based state inference  and failure recovery. This paper describes the  RAX Planner/Scheduler (RAX-PS), both in terms of  the underlying planning framework and in terms of the  fielded planner. RAX-PS plans are networks of constraints,  built incrementally by consulting a model of  the dynamics of the spacecraft. The RAX-PS planning  procedure is formally well defined and can be  proved to be complete. RAX-PS generates plans that  are temporally flexible, allowing the execution system  to adjust to actual plan execution conditions without  breaking the plan. The practical aspect, developing a  mission critical application, required paying attention  to important engineering issues such as the design of  methods for programmable search contr...
