Distributed Repositories of Highly Expressive Reusable Ontologies We describe an ongoing project to develop technology that will support collaborative construction and effective use of distributed large-scale repositories of highly expressive reusable ontologies. We are focusing on developing a distributed server architecture for ontology construction and use, representation formalisms that remove key barriers to expressing essential knowledge in and about ontologies, ontology construction tools, and tools for obtaining domain models for use in applications from large-scale ontology repositories. We are building on the results of the DARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort, specifically by using the Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) as a core representation language and the Ontolingua system as a core ontology development environment. In order to enable distributed ontology repositories and services, we are developing a distributed server architecture for ontology construction and use based on ontology servers which provide access via a network API to the contents of ontologies and to information derivable from the contents by a general purpose reasoner. Ontology servers will be analogous to data base servers and will provide services including configuration
