Treating Constraints As Objectives For Single-Objective Evolutionary Optimization This paper presents a new approach to handle constraints using evolutionary algorithms. The new technique treats constraints as objectives, and uses a multiobjective optimization approach to solve the re-stated single-objective optimization problem. The new approach is compared against other numerical and evolutionary optimization techniques in several engineering optimization problems with different kinds of constraints. The results obtained show that the new approach can consistently outperform the other techniques using relatively small sub-populations, and without a significant sacrifice in terms of performance.
