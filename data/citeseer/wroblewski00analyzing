Analyzing Relational Databases Using Rough Set Based Methods One of the most important problems in KDD applications is a size of real-world databases. In practical problems data may contain millions of records in many data tables bounded by relations. On the other hand, most of theoretical works and practical applications concentrate on relatively small data sets collected in single tables. The paper proposes a new approach to the problem of analysis of relational databases. The proposed methodology woks in adaptive way: if a considered data table is not sufficient to create satisfactory set of rules, new attributes (generated by arithmetical operations or based on database relations) are added to information system.
