Recommending Web Documents Based on User Preferences Making recommendations requires treating users as individuals. In this paper, we describe a metasearch engine available at NEC Research Institute that allows individual search strategies to be used. Each search strategy consists of a different set of sources, different query modification rules and a personalized ordering policy. We combine these three features with a dynamic interface that allows users to see the "current best" recommendations displayed at all times, and allows results to be displayed immediately upon retrieval. We present several examples where a single query produces different results, ordered based on different factors, accomplished without the use of training, or a local database.
