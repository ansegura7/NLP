Learning Fuzzy Classification Rules from Data . Automatic design of fuzzy rule-based classification systems based on labeled data is considered. It is recognized that both classification performance and interpretability are of major importance and e#ort is made to keep the resulting rule bases small and comprehensible. An iterative approach for developing fuzzy classifiers is proposed. The initial model is derived from the data and subsequently, feature selection and rule base simplification are applied to reduce the model, and a GA is used for model tuning. An application to the Wine data classification problem is shown.  1 Introduction  Rule-based expert systems are often applied to classification problems in fault detection, biology, medicinem etc. Fuzzy logic improves classification and decision support systems by allowing the use of overlapping class definitions and improves the interpretability of the results by providing more insight into the classifier structure and decision making process [13]. The automatic determination...
