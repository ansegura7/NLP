Tumor Detection in Colonoscopic Images Using Hybrid Methods for on-Line Neural Network Training In this paper the effectiveness of a new Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm in on-line Neural Network training for tumor detection is investigated. To this end, a Lamarck-inspired combination of Evolutionary Algorithms and Stochastic Gradient Descent is proposed. The Evolutionary Algorithm works on the termination point of the Stochastic Gradient Descent. Thus, the method consists in a Stochastic Gradient Descent-based on-line training stage and an Evolutionary Algorithm-based retraining stage. On-line training is considered eminently suitable for large (or even redundant) training sets and/or networks; it also helps escaping local minima and provides a more natural approach for learning nonstationary tasks. Furthermore, the notion of retraining aids the hybrid method to exhibit reliable and stable performance, and increases the generalization capability of the trained neural network. Experimental results suggest that the proposed hybrid strategy is capable to train on-line, efficiently and effectively. Here, an artificial neural network architecture has been successfully used for detecting abnormalities in colonoscopic video images.
