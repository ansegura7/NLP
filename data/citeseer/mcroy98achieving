Achieving Robust Human-Computer Communication This paper describes a computational approach to robust human-computer interaction. The approach relies on an explicit, declarative representation of the content and structure of the interaction that a computer system builds over the course of the interaction. In this paper, we will show how this representation allows the system to recognize and repair misunderstandings between the human and the computer. We demonstrate the utility of the representations by showing how they facilitate the repair process.  1 Introduction  In dialogs between people or between people and machines, understanding is an uncertain process. If the goals or beliefs of two discourse  1  participants differ, one of them might interpret an event in the dialog in a way that she believes is complete and correct, although her interpretation is not the one that the other one had intended. When this happens, we as analysts (or observers) would say that a misunderstanding has occurred. The participants themselves might...
