Viewpoint-Invariant Learning and Detection of Human Heads We present a method to learn models of human heads for the purpose of detection from different viewing angles. We focus on a model where objects are represented as constellations of rigid features (parts). Variability is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set using an interest operator followed by vector quantization. The set of model parameters, including the shape pdf, is then learned using expectation maximization. Experiments show good generalization performance to novel viewpoints and unseen faces. Performance is above    % correct with less than    s computation time per image.
