Animating Spatiotemporal Constraint Databases . Constraint databases provide a very expressive framework  for spatiotemporal database applications. However, animating such databases  is difficult because of the cost of constructing a graphical representation  of a single snapshot of a constraint database. We present a novel approach  that makes the efficient animation of constraint databases possible. The  approach is based on a new construct: parametric polygon. We present  an algorithm to construct the set of parametric polygons that represent  a given linear constraint database. We also show how to animate objects  defined by parametric polygons, analyze the computational complexity  of animation, and present empirical data to demonstrate the efficiency  of our approach.  1 Introduction  Spatiotemporal databases have recently begun to attract broader interest [10, 12, 27]. While the temporal [4, 23, 24] and spatial [14, 28] database technologies are relatively mature, their combination is far from straightforward. In this conte...
