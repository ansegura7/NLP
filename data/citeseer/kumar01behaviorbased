A Behavior-Based Intelligent Control Architecture with Application to Coordination of Multiple Underwater Vehicles The paper presents a behavior-based intelligent control architecture for designing controllers which, based on their observation of sensor signals, compute the discrete control actions. These control actions then serve as the "set-points" for the lower level controllers. The behavior-based approach yields an intelligent controller which is a cascade of a perceptor and a response controller. The perceptor extracts the relevant symbolic information from the incoming continuous sensor signals, which enables the execution of one of the behaviors. The response controller is a discrete event system that computes the discrete control actions by executing one of the enabled behaviors. The behavioral approach additionally yields a hierarchical two layered response controller, which provides better complexity management. The inputs from the perceptor are used to first compute the higher level activities, called behaviors, and next to compute the corresponding lower level activities, called actio...
