Dolan and Jorge J. Mor'e Abstract  We describe version 2.0 of the COPS set of nonlinearly constrained optimization problems. We have added new problems, as well as streamlined and improved most of the problems. We also provide a comparison of the LANCELOT, LOQO, MINOS, and SNOPT solvers on these problems. Introduction  The COPS [5] test set provides a modest selection of difficult nonlinearly constrai...
