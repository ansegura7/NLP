XML Dataspaces for Mobile Agent Coordination This paper presents XMARS, a programmable coordination architecture for  Internet applications based on mobile agents. In XMARS, agents coordinate --  both with each other and with their current execution environment -- through  programmable XML dataspaces, accessed by agents in a Linda-like fashion. This  suits very well the characteristics of the Internet environment: on the one hand, it  offers all the advantages of XML in terms of interoperability and standard  representation of information; on the other hand, it enforces open and uncoupled  interactions, as required by the dynamicity of the environment and by the mobility  of the application components. In addition, coordination in XMARS is made more  flexible and secure by the capability of programming the behaviour of the  coordination media in reaction to the agents' accesses. An application example  related to the management of on-line academic courses shows the suitability and  the effectiveness of the XMARS architecture.  Ke...
