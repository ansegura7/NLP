Clause Aggregation Using Linguistic Knowledge By combining multiple clauses into one single sentence, a text generation system can express the same amount of information in fewer words and at the same time, produce a great variety of complex constructions. In this paper, we describe hypotactic and paratactic operators for generating complex sentences from clause-sized semantic representations. These two types of operators are portable and reusable because they are based on general resources such as the lexicon and the grammar. 1 Introduction  An expression is more concise than another expression if it conveys the same amount of information in fewer words. Complex sentences generated by combining clauses are more concise than corresponding simple sentences because multiple references to the recurring entities are removed. For example, clauses like "Jones is a patient" and "Jones has hypertension" can be combined into a more concise sentence "Jones is a hypertensive patient." To illustrate the common occurrence of such repeated enti...
