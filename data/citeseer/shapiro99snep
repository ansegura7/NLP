SNePS: A Logic for Natural Language Understanding and Commonsense Reasoning The use of logic for knowledge representation and reasoning systems is controversial. There are, indeed, several ways that standard First Order Predicate Logic is inappropriate for modelling natural language understanding and commonsense reasoning. However, a more appropriate logic can be designed. This chapter presents several aspects of such a logic.  1 Introduction  My colleagues, students, and I have been engaged in a long-term project to build a natural language using intelligent agent. While our approach to natural language understanding (NLU) and commonsense reasoning (CSR) has been logic-based, we have thought that the logics developed for metamathematics, e.g. (Kleene, 1950), are not the best ones for our purpose. Instead, we have designed new logics, better suited for NLU and CSR. The current version of these logics constitutes the formal language and inference mechanism of the knowledge representation/reasoning (KRR) system, SNePS 2.4 (Shapiro and The SNePS Implementation Gr...
