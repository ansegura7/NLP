Active Databases and Agent Systems - A Comparison This paper examines Active Databases and Agent Systems, comparing their purpose, structure, functionality, and implementation. Our presentation is aimed primarily at an audience familiar with active database technology. We show that they draw upon very similar paradigms in their quest to supply reactivity. This presents opportunities for migration of techniques and formalisms between the two fields. 1  fjbailey,kemp,dnk,raog@cs.mu.oz.au  2  georgeff@aaii.oz.au  3  Appears in T.Sellis, editor, Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Rules in Database Systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 985, pages 342-356, Athens, Greece, 1995.  1 Introduction  In recent times, two technologies have become prominent in the database and artificial intelligence research communities. An Active Database (ADB) is a system which supplements traditional database functionality by reacting automatically to state changes, both internal and external, without user intervention. An Agent System (A...
