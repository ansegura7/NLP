Advanced DeInterlacing techniques with the use of Zonal Based Algorithms This paper describes a new highly efficient aleinterlacing approach based on motion estimation and compensation techniques. The proposed technique mainly benefits from the motion vector properties of zonal based algorithms, such as the Advanced Predictive Diamond Zonal Search (APDZS) and the Predictive Motion Vector Field Adaptive Search Technique (PMVFAST), multihypothesis motion compensation, but also an additional motion classification phase where, depending on the motion of a pixel, additional spatial and temporal information is also considered to further improve performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of these algorithms, especially when compared to standard deinterlacing techniques such as the line doubling and line averaging algorithms.
