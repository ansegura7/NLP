Reinforcement Learning for Visual Servoing of a Mobile Robot A novel reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to a visual servoing task on a real mobile robot. There is no requirement for camera calibration, an actuator model or a knowledgeable teacher. The controller learns from a critic which gives a scalar reward. The learning algorithm handles continuously valued states and actions and can learn from good and bad experiences including data gathered while performing unrelated behaviours and from historical data. Experimental results are presented. 1 Introduction Visual servoing consists of moving some part of a robot to a desired position using visual feedback [ Hutchinson et al., 1996 ] . It is a basic building block for purposeful robot behaviours such as foraging, target pursuit and landmark based navigation. Some degree of calibration is generally required to achieve visual servoing. This calibration can be a time consuming and error prone process. In this work we show that reinforcement based learning can eliminate the ca...
