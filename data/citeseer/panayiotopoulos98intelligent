An Intelligent Agent Framework In VRML Worlds actions, e.g. move to next room, are received by it and consequently send to the EAC. Finally, the abstract action arrives at the Virtual Reality Management Unit that specifies in detail the received actions. It provides specific values concerning the orientation and position of the avatar, e.g. it specifies the coordinates, orientation and path so that it can successfully move to the next room, and sends them as commands to the Virtual Reality World Browser. The browser executes the command by altering the virtual environment appropriately. When changes have been performed the AEC unit notifies the logical core that the action has been successfully executed and the logical core goes on by updating its internal and external state. Consequently, the agent looks around into the virtual space, gathers any additional information and decides the next step it should take to satisfy its goals.
