A Computational Taxonomy and Survey of Neural Network Models  We survey and summarize the existing literature on the computational aspects of neural network models, by presenting a detailed taxonomy of the various models according to their computational characteristics. The criteria of classication include e.g. the architecture of the network (feedforward vs. recurrent), time model (discrete vs. continuous) , state type (binary vs. analog), weight constraints (symmetric vs. asymmetric), network size (nite nets vs. infinite families), computation type (deterministic vs. probabilistic) , etc. The underlying results concerning the computational power of perceptron, RBF, winner-take-all, and spiking neural networks are briefly surveyed, with pointers to the relevant literature.
