On Computing Functions with Uncertainty We study the problem of computing a function f(x1;:::; xn) giv en that the actual values of the variables xi's are kno wn only with some uncertainty. F or each variable xi, aninterval Ii is kno wn such that the value of xi is guaranteed to fall within this interval. Any such interval can be probed to obtain the actual value of the underlying variable; how ever, there is a cost associated with each suc h probe. The goal is to adaptively iden tify a minimum cost sequence of probes suc h that regardless of the actual values tak en b y the unprobed xi's, the v alue of the functionf can be computed to within a speci ed precision. We design online algorithms for this problem when f is either the selection function or an aggregation function such as sum or average. We consider three natural models of precision and give algorithms for each model. We analyze our algorithms in the framework of competitive analysis and sho w that our algorithms are asymptotically optimal. Finally, we also study online algorithms for functions that are obtained by composing together selection and aggregation functions. 1.
