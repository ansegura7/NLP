A Hybrid Model For Sharing Information Between Fuzzy, Uncertain And Default Reasoning Models In Multi-Agent Systems This paper develops a hybrid model which provides a unified framework for the fol-  lowing four kinds of reasoning: 1) Zadeh's fuzzy approximate reasoning; 2) truthqualification  uncertain reasoning with respect to fuzzy propositions; 3) fuzzy default  reasoning (proposed, in this paper, as an extension of Reiter's default reasoning); and 4)  truth-qualification uncertain default reasoning associated with fuzzy statements (developed  in this paper to enrich fuzzy default reasoning with uncertain information). Our  hybrid model has the following characteristics: 1) basic uncertainty is estimated in terms  of words or phrases in natural language and basic propositions are fuzzy; 2) uncertainty,  linguistically expressed, can be handled in default reasoning; and 3) the four kinds of rea-  soning models mentioned above and their combination models will be the special cases of  our hybrid model. Moreover, our model allows the reasoning to be performed in the case  in which the information is fuzzy, uncertain and partial. More importantly, the problems  of sharing the information among heterogeneous fuzzy, uncertain and default reasoning  models can be solved efficiently by using our model. Given this, our framework can be  used as a basis for information sharing and exchange in knowledge-based multi-agent  systems for practical applications such as automated group negotiations. Actually, to  build such a foundation is the motivation of this paper
