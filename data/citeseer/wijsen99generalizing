Generalizing Temporal Dependencies for Non-Temporal Dimensions Recently, there has been a lot of interest in temporal granularity, and its applications in temporal dependency  theory and data mining. Generalization hierarchies used in multi-dimensional databases and OLAP serve a role  similar to that of time granularity in temporal databases, but they also apply to non-temporal dimensions, like  space.
