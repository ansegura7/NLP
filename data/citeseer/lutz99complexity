On the Complexity of Terminological Reasoning TBoxes are an important component of knowledge representation systems based on description logics (DLs) since they allow for a natural representation of terminological knowledge. Largely due to a classical result given by Nebel [ 20 ] , complexity analyses for DLs have, until now, mostly focused on reasoning without (acyclic) TBoxes. In this paper, we concentrate on DLs, for which reasoning without TBoxes is  PSpace-complete, and show that there exist logics for which the complexity of reasoning remains in PSpace if acyclic TBoxes are added and also logics for which the complexity increases. An example for a logic of the former type is ALC while examples for logics of the latter kind include ALC(D) and ALCF . This demonstrates that it is necessary to take TBoxes into account for complexity analyses. Furthermore, we show that reasoning with the description logic ALCRP(D)  is NExpTime-complete regardless of whether TBoxes are admitted or not. 1 Introduction  A core feature of description...
