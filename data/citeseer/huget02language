A Language for Exchanging Agent UML Protocol Diagrams For several years, interaction protocol designers have a new formalism which takes into account multiagent system features: autonomy, cooperation, etc. This formalism is called Agent UML [6]. For the moment, designers can describe protocols with the Agent UML protocol diagrams but they do not have a textual language in order to exchange protocols or to check properties on them. The aim of this paper is to provide such a language. This language is called AXF (Agent UML eXchange Format) and is structured as an XML file. This paper presents the syntax of this language and applies AXF to the example of the English Auction Protocol. This paper is published as the technical report ULCS-02-009 from the department of computer science, University of Liverpool.
