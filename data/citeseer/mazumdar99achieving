Achieving Consistency in Mobile Databases through Localization in PRO-MOTION There is great need and potential for traditional transaction support in a mobile computing environment. However, owing to the inherent limitations of mobile computing, we need to augment the well-developed techniques of Database Management Systems with new approaches. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of assuring data consistency. Our approach of localization is to reformulate global constraints so as to enhance the autonomy of the mobile hosts. We show how this approach unifies techniques of maintaining replicated data with methods of enforcing polynomial inequalities. We also discuss how localization can be implemented in PRO-MOTION, a flexible infrastructure for transaction processing in a mobile environment.  1. Introduction  Thanks to the relentless advances in semiconductors, the number of users with mobile computers (we will refer to these machines as mobile hosts or MHs) continues to increase. These users have discovered that exciting developments in wireless technology...
