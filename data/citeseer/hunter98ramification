Ramification Analysis Using Causal Mapping To operate in the real-world, intelligent agents constantly need to absorb new information, and to consider the ramifications of it. This raises interesting questions for knowledge representation and reasoning. Here we consider ramification analysis in which we wish to determine both the likely outcomes from events occuring and the less likely, but very significant outcomes, from events occuring. To formalize ramification analysis, we introduce the notion of causal maps for modelling "causal relationships" between events. In particular, we consider existential event classes, for example presidential-election, with instances being true, false,  or unknown, and directional events classes, for example inflation, with instances being increasing, decreasing or unchanging. Using causal maps, we can propagate new information to determine possible ramifications. These ramifications are also described in terms of events. Whilst causal maps offer a lucid view on ramifications, we also want to su...
