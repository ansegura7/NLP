A Shopping Agent That Automatically Constructs Wrappers for Semi-Structured Online Vendors . This paper proposes a shopping agent with a robust inductive  learning method that automatically constructs wrappers for semistructured  online stores. Strong biases assumed in many existing systems  are weakened so that the real stores with reasonably complex document  structures can be handled. Our method treats a logical line as a basic  unit, and recognizes the position and the structure of product descriptions  by finding the most frequent pattern from the sequence of logical  line information in output HTML pages. This method is capable of analyzing  product descriptions that comprise multiple logical lines, and  even those with extra or missing attributes. Experimental tests on over  60 sites show that it successfully constructs correct wrappers for most  real stores.  1 Introduction  A shopping agent is a mediator system that extracts the product descriptions from several online stores on a user's behalf. Since the stores are heterogeneous, a procedure for extracting the cont...
