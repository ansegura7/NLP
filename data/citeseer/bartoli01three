Three New Algorithms for Projective Bundle Adjustment with Minimum Parameters Bundle adjustment is a technique used to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of structure and motion from image feature correspondences. It practice, large non-linear systems have to be solved, most of the time using an iterative optimization process starting from a sub-optimal solution obtained by using linear methods. The behaviour, in terms of convergence, and the computational cost of this process depend on the parameterization used to represent the problem, i.e. of structure and motion.
