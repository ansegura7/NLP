Transaction Oriented Computational Models For Multi-Agent Systems BDI (Belief, Desire, Intention) is a mature and commonly adopted architecture  for Intelligent Agents. However, the current computational model adopted  by BDI has a number of problems with concurrency control, recoverability and  predictability. This has hindered the construction of agents having robust and predictable  behaviour. Indeed the conceptual and practical tools needed for building  dependable agent systems, resilient to faults and other unexpected situations, are  still at an early stage of research.
