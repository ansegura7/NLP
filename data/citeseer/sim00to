To Boldly Go: Bayesian Exploration for Mobile Robots This work addresses the problem of robot exploration. That is, the task of automatically learning a map of the environment which is useful for mobile robot navigation and localization. The exploration mechanism is intended to be applicable to an arbitrary environment, and is independent of the particular representation of the world. We take an information-theoretic approach and avoid the use of arbitrary heuristics. Preliminary results are presented and we discuss future directions for investigation.
