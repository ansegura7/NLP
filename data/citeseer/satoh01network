Network Processing of Mobile Agents, by Mobile Agents, for Mobile Agents . This paper presents a framework for building network protocols for  migrating mobile agents over a network. The framework allows network protocols  for agent migration to be naturally implemented within mobile agents and  to be constructed in a hierarchy as most data transmission protocols are. These  protocols are given as mobile agents and they can transmit other mobile agents  to remote hosts as first-class objects. Since they can be dynamically deployed at  remote hosts by migrating the agents that carry them, these protocols can dynamically  and flexibly customize network processing for agent migration according  to the requirements of respective visiting agents and changes in the environments.  A prototype implementation was built on a Java-based mobile agent system, and  several practical protocols for agent migration were designed and implemented.  The framework can make major contributions to mobile agent technology for  telecommunication systems.  1
