Enabling knowledge representation on the Web by extending RDF Schema Recently, there has been a wide interest in using ontologies on the Web. As a basis for this, RDF Schema (RDFS) provides means to define vocabulary, structure and constraints for expressing metadata about Web resources. However, formal semantics are not provided, and the expressivity of it is not enough for full-fledged ontological modeling and reasoning. In this paper, we will show how RDFS can be extended in such a way that a full knowledge representation (KR) language can be expressed in it, thus enriching it with the required additional expressivity and the semantics of this language. We do this by describing the ontology language OIL as an extension of RDFS. An important advantage of our approach is a maximal backward compatability with RDFS: any meta-data in OIL format can still be partially interpreted by any RDFS-only-processor. The OIL extension of RDFS has been carefully engineered so that such a partial interpretation of OIL meta-data is still correct under the intended semantics of RDFS: simply ignoring the OIL specific portions of an OIL document yields a correct RDF(S) document whose intended RDFS semantics is precisely a subset of the semantics of the full OIL statements. In this way, our approach ensures maximal sharing of meta-data on the Web: even partial interpretation of meta-data by less semantically aware processors will yield a correct partial interpretation of the meta-data. We conclude that our method of extending is equally applicable to other KR formalisms. 1 1
