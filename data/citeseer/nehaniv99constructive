Constructive Biology and Approaches to Temporal Grounding in Post-Reactive Robotics Constructive Biology (as opposed to descriptive biology) means understanding biological mechanisms through building systems that exhibit life-like properties. Applications include learning engineering tricks from biological systems, as well as the validation in biological modelling. In particular, biological systems (unlike reactive robots) in the course of development and experience become temporally grounded. Researchers attempting to transcend mere reactivity have been inspired by the drives, motivations, homeostasis, hormonal control, and emotions of animals. In order to contextualize and modulate behavior, these ideas have been introduced into robotics and synthetic agents, while further flexibility is achieved by introducing learning.  Broadening scope of the temporal horizon further requires post-reactive techniques that address not only the action in the now, although such action may perhaps be modulated by drives and affect. Support is needed for expressing and benefitting from...
