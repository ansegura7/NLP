The influence of design techniques on user interfaces: the DigiStrips experiment for air traffic control Graphical user interfaces have limitations in terms of the information bandwidth they provide between users and systems. This can impede the redesign of systems previously based on more physical media: information may be less appropriately displayed, and shared cognition between users can be reduced. However, in parallel with research on new user interaction techniques, a more systematic use of visual design  techniques can relieve those limitations. This article  explores some of those techniques and how they can be applied, through a design experiment. Virtuosi and DigiStrips are two user interface prototypes developed within a research program on air traffic control workstations, which make use of touch screens and served as a basis for research on the use of graphical design techniques in user interfaces. This paper describes the lessons learnt in that experience and  argues that techniques such as animation, font design, careful use of graphical design techniques can augment the p...
