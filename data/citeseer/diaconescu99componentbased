Component-based Algebraic Specification and Verification in CafeOBJ . We present a formal method for component-based system specification  and verification which is based on the new algebraic specification language  CafeOBJ, which is a modern successor of OBJ incorporating several new developments  in algebraic specification theory and practice.  We first give an overview of the main features of CafeOBJ, including its logical  foundations, and then we focus on the behavioural specification paradigm in  CafeOBJ, surveying the object-oriented CafeOBJ specification and verification  methodology based on behavioural abstraction.  The last part of this paper further focuses on a component-based behavioural  specification and verification methodology which features high reusability of  both specification code and verification proof scores. This methodology constitutes  the basis for an industrial strength formal method around CafeOBJ.  1 Introduction  CafeOBJ (whose definition is given by [7])is a modern successor of the OBJ language incorporating several ne...
