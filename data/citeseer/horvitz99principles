Principles of Mixed-Initiative User Interfaces Recent debate has centered on the relative promise of focusing user-interface research on developing new  metaphors and tools that enhance users' abilities to directly manipulate objects versus directing effort toward developing interface agents that provide automation. In this paper, we review principles that show promise for allowing engineers to enhance human---computer interaction through an elegant coupling of automated services with direct manipulation. Key ideas will be highlighted in terms of the LookOut system for scheduling and meeting management.  Keywords  Intelligent agents, direct manipulation, user modeling, probability, decision theory, UI design  INTRODUCTION  There has been debate among researchers about where great opportunities lay for innovating in the realm of human--- computer interaction [10]. One group of researchers has expressed enthusiasm for the development and application of new kinds of automated services, often referred to as interface "agents." The effo...
