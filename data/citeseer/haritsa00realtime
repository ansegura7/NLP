Real-Time Index Concurrency Control Real-time database systems are expected to rely heavily on indexes to speed up data access and thereby help more transactions meet their deadlines. Accordingly, highperformance index concurrency control (ICC) protocols are required to prevent contention for the index from becoming a bottleneck. In this paper, we develop real-time variants of a representative set of classical B-tree ICC protocols and, using a detailed simulation model, compare their performance for real-time transactions with firm deadlines. We also present and evaluate a new real-time ICC protocol called GUARD-link that augments the classical B-link protocol with a feedback-based admission control mechanism. Both point and range queries, as well as the undos of the index actions of aborted transactions are included in the scope of our study. The performance metrics used in evaluating the ICC protocols are the percentage of transactions that miss their deadlines and the fairness with respect to transaction type and size...
