Hybrid Methods Using Evolutionary Algorithms for On-line Training A novel hybrid evolutionary approach is presented in this paper for improving the performance of neural network classifiers in slowly varying environments. For this purpose, we investigate a coupling of Differential Evolution Strategy and Stochastic Gradient Descent, using both the global search capabilities of Evolutionary Strategies and the effectiveness of on-line gradient descent. The use of Differential Evolution Strategy is related to the concept of evolution of a number of individuals from generation to generation and that of on-line gradient descent to the concept of adaptation to the environment by learning. The hybrid algorithm is tested in two real-life image processing applications. Experimental results suggest that the hybrid strategy is capable to train on-line effectively leading to networks with increased generalization capability.
