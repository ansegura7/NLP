Abduction with Negation as Failure for Active and Reactive Rules . Recent work has suggested abductive logic programming as a  suitable formalism to represent active databases and intelligent agents. In  particular, abducibles in abductive logic programs can be used to represent  actions, and integrity constaints in abductive logic programs can be  used to represent active rules of the kind encountered in active databases  and reactive rules incorporating reactive behaviour in agents. One would  expect that, in this approach, abductive proof procedures could provide  the engine underlying active database management systems and the behaviour  of agents. We analyse existing abductive proof procedures and  argue that they are inadequate in handling these applications. The inadequacy  is due to the inappropriate treatment of negative literals in  integrity constraints. We propose a new abductive proof procedure and  give examples of how this proof procedure can be used to achieve active  behaviour in (deductive) databases and reactivity in agents. Final...
