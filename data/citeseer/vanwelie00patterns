Patterns as Tools for User Interface Design . Designing usable systems is difficult and designers need effective  tools that are usable themselves. Effective design tools should be based on  proven knowledge of design. Capturing knowledge about the successful design  of usable systems is important for both novice and experienced designers and  traditionally, this knowledge has largely been described in guidelines. However,  guidelines have shown to have problems concerning selection, validity and applicability.  Patterns have emerged as a possible solution to some of the problems  from which guidelines suffer. Patterns focus on the context of a problem and solution  thereby guiding the designer in using the design knowledge. Patterns for  architecture or software engineering are not identical in structure and user interface  design also requires its own structure for patterns, focusing on usability.  This paper explores how patterns for user interface design must be structured in  order to be effective and usable tools for desig...
