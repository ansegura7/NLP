A Fine-Grained Model for Code Mobility . In this paper we take the extreme view that every line of code is potentially mobile, i.e., may be duplicated and/or moved from one program context to another on the same host or across the network. Our motivation is to gain a better understanding of the range of constructs and issues facing the designer of a mobile code system, in a setting that is abstract and unconstrained by compilation and performance considerations traditionally associated with programming language design. Incidental to our study is an evaluation of the expressive power of Mobile  Unity, a notation and proof logic for mobile computing. 1 Introduction  The advent of world-wide networks, the emergence of wireless communication, and the growing popularity of the Java language are contributing to a growing interest in dynamic and reconfigurable systems. Code mobility is viewed by many as a key element of a class of novel design strategies which no longer assume that all the resources needed to accomplish a task are...
