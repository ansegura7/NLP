An Overview of World Wide Web Search Technologies With over 800 million pages covering most areas of human endeavor, the World  Wide Web is fertile ground for information retrieval. Numerous search technologies  have been applied to Web searches, and the dominant search method has yet to be  identified. This chapter provides an overview of existing Web search technologies and  classifies them into six categories: (i) hyperlink exploration, (ii) information retrieval,  (iii) metasearches, (iv) SQL approaches, (v) content-based multimedia searches, and  (vi) others. A comparative study of some major commercial and experimental search  services is presented, and some future research directions for Web searches are suggested.
