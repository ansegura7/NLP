Web Genre Visualization Web users vary widely in terms of their expertise on the topics for which they search, the amount of detail they seek, etc. Unfortunately, today's one-size-fits-all Web search services do not cater to such individual preferences. For example, it is difficult to query for documents that give extensive detail but assume modest prior expertise. We describe how shallow text classification techniques can be used to sort the documents returned by Web search services according to genre dimensions such as level of expertise and amount of detail, and propose a simple visualization interface that helps users rapidly find appropriate documents. (Keywords: document genre; information retrieval, visualisation, text classification, shallow linguistic processing)  Motivation  Consider two users seeking information about Pearson' correlation coefficient. Alice is writing a data-analysis program and needs a web page to remind her of the equations. Bob, a teacher, wants to point his pupils to an overview that isn't bogged down in equations.
