Normal Forms for Defeasible Logic Defeasible logic is an important logic-programming based nonmonotonic reasoning formalism which has an efficient implementation. It makes use of facts, strict rules, defeasible rules, defeaters, and a superiority relation. Representation results are important because they can help the assimilation of a concept by confining attention to its critical aspects. In this paper we derive some representation results for defeasible logic. In particular we show that the superiority relation does not add to the expressive power of the logic, and can be simulated by other ingredients in a modular way. Also, facts can be simulated by strict rules. Finally we show that we cannot simplify the logic any further in a modular way: Strict rules, defeasible rules, and defeaters form a minimal set of independent ingredients in the logic. 1 Introduction  Normal forms play an important role in computer science. Examples of areas where normal forms have proved fruitful include logic [10], where normal forms o...
