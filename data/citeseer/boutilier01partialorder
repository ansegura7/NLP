Partial-Order Planning with Concurrent Interacting Actions In order to generate plans for agents with multiple actuators, agent teams, or distributed  controllers, we must be able to represent and plan using concurrent actions with  interacting effects. This has historically been considered a challenging task requiring a  temporal planner with the ability to reason explicitly about time. We show that with  simple modifications, the STRIPS action representation language can be used to represent  interacting actions. Moreover, algorithms for partial-order planning require only small  modifications in order to be applied in such multiagent domains. We demonstrate this fact  by developing a sound and complete partial-order planner for planning with concurrent interacting  actions, POMP, that extends existing partial-order planners in a straightforward  way. These results open the way to the use of partial-order planners for the centralized  control of cooperative multiagent systems.  1. Introduction  In order to construct plans for agents with mul...
