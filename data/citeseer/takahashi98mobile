Mobile Info Search: Information Integration for Location-Aware Computing this paper we introduce a research project entitled Mobile Info Search (MIS), and describe  its goal, architecture, implementation, and experimental results.  The goal of MIS is to collect, structure, and integrate distributed and diverse local information  from the Internet in a practicable form and make it available through a simple interface  to mobile users in various situations or contexts. We do this in a location-oriented way.  The experimental MIS application features a "location-oriented meta search" for Web  database servers, a "location-oriented robot-based search" called kokono Search for distributed  Web documents, and a simple interface based on the latitude and longitude of the user's location,  which are obtained from the user's PHS or GPS.  Analysis of a trial service shows that multiple services, such as maps and textual information,  are often requested together for one location within a
