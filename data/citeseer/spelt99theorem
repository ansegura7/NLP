A Theorem Prover-Based Analysis Tool for Object-Oriented Databases We present a theorem-prover based analysis tool for object-oriented database systems with integrity  constraints. Object-oriented database specifications are mapped to higher-order logic (HOL). This allows  us to reason about the semantics of database operations using a mechanical theorem prover such  as Isabelle or PVS. The tool can be used to verify various semantics requirements of the schema (such as  transaction safety, compensation, and commutativity) to support the advanced transaction models used in  workflow and cooperative work. We give an example of method safety analysis for the generic structure  editing operations of a cooperative authoring system.  1 Introduction  Object-oriented specification methodologies and object-oriented programming have become increasingly important in the past ten years. Not surprisingly, this has recently led to an interest in object-oriented program verification in the theorem prover community, mainly using higher-order logic (HOL). Several dif...
