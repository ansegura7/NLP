Extracting Semistructured Data - Lessons Learnt The Yellow Pages Assistant (YPA) is a natural language dialogue system which guides a user through a dialogue in order to retrieve addresses from the Yellow Pages. Part of the work in this project is concerned with the construction of a Backend, i.e. the database extracted from the raw input text that is needed for the online access of the addresses. Here we discuss some aspects involved in this task as well as report on experiences which might be interesting for other projects as well.
