Algorithmics and Applications of Tree and Graph Searching Modern search engines answer keyword-based queries extremely efficiently. The impressive speed is due to clever inverted index structures, caching, a domain-independent knowledge of strings, and thousands of machines. Several research efforts have attempted to generalize keyword search to keytree and keygraph searching, because trees and graphs have many applications in next-generation database systems. This paper surveys both algorithms and applications, giving some emphasis to our own work.
