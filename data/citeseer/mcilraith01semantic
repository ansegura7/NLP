Semantic Web Services hose properties, capabilities,  interfaces, and effects are encoded in an unambiguous,  machine-understandable form.  The realization of the Semantic Web is underway  with the development of new AI-inspired content  markup languages, such as OIL,  3  DAML+OIL  (www.daml.org/2000/10/daml-oil), and DAML-L (the  last two are members of the DARPA Agent Markup  Language (DAML) family of languages).  4  These languages  have a well-defined semantics and enable the  markup and manipulation of complex taxonomic and  logical relations between entities on the Web. A fundamental  component of the Semantic Web will be the markup of Web services to make them computer-interpretable, use-apparent, and agent-ready. This article addresses precisely this component.  We present an approach to Web service markup that provides an agent-independent declarative API capturing the data and metadata associated with a service together with specifications of its pro
