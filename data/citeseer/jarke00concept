Concept Based Design of Data Warehouses: The DWQ Demonstrators The ESPRIT Project DWQ (Foundations of Data Warehouse Quality) aimed at improving the quality of DW design and operation through systematic enrichment of the semantic foundations of data warehousing. Logic-based knowledge representation and reasoning techniques were developed to control accuracy, consistency, and completeness via advanced conceptual modeling techniques for source integration, data reconciliation, and multi-dimensional aggregation. This is complemented by quantitative optimization techniques for view materialization, optimizing timeliness and responsiveness without losing the semantic advantages from the conceptual approach. At the operational level, query rewriting and materialization refreshment algorithms exploit the knowledge developed at design time. The demonstration shows the interplay of these tools under a shared metadata repository, based on an example extracted from an application at Telecom Italia.  1 Overview of the Demonstration  The demonstration follows ...
