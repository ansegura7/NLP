Data Stream Quality: Towards Parallel and . . . Perhaps the single most critical factor that limits today's utility of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is scalability. Scalability is the main consequence of ever-increasing collections of mass data whereas data mining algorithms impose limits by their inherent computational complexity. One line of attack is to reduce the amount of data during preprocessing, that is, by exploring the raw data for
