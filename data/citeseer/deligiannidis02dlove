DLoVe: Using Constraints to Allow Parallel Processing in Multi-User Virtual Reality In this paper, we introduce DLoVe, a new paradigm for designing and implementing distributed and nondistributed virtual reality applications, using one-way constraints. DLoVe allows programs written in its framework to be executed on multiple computers for  improved performance. It also allows easy specification and implementation of multi-user interfaces. DLoVe hides all the networking aspects of message passing among the machines in the distributed environment and performs the needed network optimizations. As a result, a user of DLoVe does not need to understand parallel and distributed programming to use the system; he or she  needs only be able to use the serial version of the user  interface description language. Parallelizing the computation is performed by DLoVe, without modifying the interface description.
