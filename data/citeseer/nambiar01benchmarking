Benchmarking XML Management Systems: The XOO7 Way The effectiveness of existing XML query languages has been studied by many who focused  on the comparison of linguistic features, implicitly reflecting the fact that most XML tools exist  only on paper. In this paper, with a focus on efficiency and concreteness, we propose a pragmatic  first step toward the systematic benchmarking of XML query processing platforms. We begin by  identifying the necessary functionalities an XML data management system should support. We  review existing approaches for managing XML data and the query processing capabilities of these  approaches. We then compare three XML query benchmarks XMach-1, XMark and XOO7 and  discuss the applicability, strengths and limitations of these benchmarks. We highlight the bias of  these benchmarks towards the data centric view of XML and motivate our selection of XOO7 to  extend with document centric queries. We complete XOO7 to capture the information retrieval  capabilities of XML management systems. Finally we summarize our contributions and discuss  future directions.
