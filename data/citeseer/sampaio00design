Design and Implementation of a Deductive Query Language for ODMG Compliant Object Databases Introduction  Deductive object-oriented databases (DOODs) seek to provide the combined support for the expressive modelling features available in the object-oriented data model and the powerful query language features available in deductive databases. When successfully engineered, this combination can broaden the spectrum of declarative queries that can be supported by the DBMS, and ease their implementation due to the increased functionality in the query capabilities of the resulting system. The extra leverage obtained from support for deductive functionality is relevant to building database middleware for distributed information systems [19], managing semistructured data [11], and for building decision support and knowledge discovery systems [4].  Unlike deductive relational database systems (DRDBs), which were designed and implemented based on the formal denition of the relational data model by Codd, and on the widely researched deductive query language model (language cons
