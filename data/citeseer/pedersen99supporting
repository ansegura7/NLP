Supporting Imprecision in Multidimensional Databases Using Granularities On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) technologies are being used widely for business-data analysis, and these technologies are also being used increasingly in medical applications, e.g., for patient-data analysis. The lack of effective means of handling data imprecision, which occurs when exact values are not known precisely or are entirely missing, represents a major obstacle in applying OLAP technology to the medical domain, as well as many other domains. OLAP systems are mainly based on a multidimensional model of data and include constructs such as dimension hierarchies and granularities. This paper develops techniques for the handling of imprecision that aim to maximally reusing these already existing constructs. With imprecise data now available in the database, queries are tested to determine whether or not they may be answered precisely given the available data; if not, alternative queries that are unaffected by the imprecision are suggested. When a user elects to proceed with a query that is affected by imprecision, techniques are proposed that take into account the imprecision in the grouping of the data, in the subsequent aggregate computation, and in the presentation of the imprecise result to the user. The approach is capable of exploiting existing multidimensional query processing techniques such as pre-aggregation, yielding an effective approach with low computational overhead and that may be implemented using current technology. The paper illustrates how to implement the approach using SQL databases.
