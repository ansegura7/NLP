The Omnipresence of Case-Based Reasoning in Science and Application A surprisingly large number of research disciplines have contributed towards the development of knowledge on lazy problem solving, which ischaracterized by its storage of ground cases and its demand driven response to queries. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an alternative, increasingly popular approach for designing expert systems that implements this approach. This paper lists pointers to some contributions in some related disciplines that o er insights for CBR research. We then outline a small number of Navy applications based on this approach that demonstrate its breadth of applicability. Finally, we list a few successful and failed attempts to apply CBR, and list some predictions on the future roles of CBR in applications. 1 Case-Based Reasoning Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a multi-disciplinary subject that focuses on the reuse of experiences (i.e., cases). It is di cult to nd consensus on more detailed de nitions of CBR because it means di erent things to di erent groups of people. For example, consider its interpretation by the following three groups: Cognitive Scientists: CBR is a plausible high-level model for cognitive processing (Kolodner,
