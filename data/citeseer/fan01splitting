On splitting and Cloning Agents Embedded with cloning mechanisms, an agent can balance its own loads by discharging computing tasks to its clones when it is over-loaded. In addition, it's more reasonable to transfer the smarter, smaller clones of an agent rather than the bulky agent itself in mobile computing. In this paper, a simple BDI agent model is formally established. Using this model, the semantics of constructing new agents by inheritance and self-identifying behavior of existing agents are precisely de  ned. Four kinds of cloning mechanisms are identi  ed, the properties of each cloning mechanism and the relationships in between are studied, and some implementation issues are also discussed.
