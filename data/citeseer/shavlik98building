Building Intelligent Agents for Web-Based Tasks: A Theory-Refinement Approach We present and evaluate an infrastructure with which to rapidly and easily build intelligent software agents for Web-based tasks. Our design is centered around two basic functions: ScoreThisLink  and ScoreThisPage. If given highly accurate such functions, standard heuristic search would lead to efficient retrieval of useful information. Our approach allows users to tailor our system 's behavior by providing approximate advice about the above functions. This advice is mapped into neural network implementations of the two functions. Subsequent reinforcements from the Web (e.g., dead links) and any ratings of retrieved pages that the user wishes to provide are, respectively, used to refine the link- and page-scoring functions. Hence, our agent architecture provides an appealing middle ground between nonadaptive "agent" programming languages and systems that solely learn user preferences from the user's ratings of pages. We present a case study where we provide some simple advice and speci...
