Towards UML-based Analysis and Design of Multi-Agent Systems The visual modeling facilities of the UML do not provide sufficient means to support the design of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we are investigating the development phases of requirements analysis, design, and code generation for multi agent systems. In the requirements analysis phase, we are using extended use case diagrams to identify agents and their relationship to the environment. In the design phase, we are using stereotyped class and object diagrams to model different agent types and their related goals and strategies. While these diagrams define the static agent system architecture, dynamic agent behavior is modeled in statecharts with respect to the BDI  1 agent approach. Concerning code generation, we show how the used diagrams can be taken to generate code for CASA, our executable agent specification language that is integrated into an existing multi-agent framework.  1
