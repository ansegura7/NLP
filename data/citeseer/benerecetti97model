Model Checking Multiagent Systems Model checking is a very successful technique which has been applied in the design and verification of finite state concurrent reactive processes. In this paper we show how this technique can be lifted to be applicable to multiagent systems. Our approach allows us to reuse the technology and tools developed in model checking, to design and verify multiagent systems in a modular and incremental way, and also to have a very efficient model checking algorithm. 1 Introduction  Model checking is a very successful automatic technique which has been devised for the design and verification of finite state reactive systems, e.g., sequential circuit designs, communication protocols, and safety critical control systems (see, e.g., [2]). There is evidence that model checking, when applicable, is far more successful than the other approaches to formal methods and verification (e.g., first order or inductive theorem proving, tableau based reasoning about modal satisfiability). Nowadays many very eff...
