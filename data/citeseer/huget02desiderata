Desiderata for Agent Oriented Programming Languages Multiagent system designers need programming languages in order to develop agents and multiagent systems. Current approaches consist to use classical programming languages like C or C++ and above all Java which is the most preferred language by agent community thanks to its rich library of functions. The aim of Java is not to design multiagent systems so it does not encompass multiagent features. The aim of this paper is to present a set of characteristics which could be present in an agent-oriented programming language. This paper also describes what kind of multiagent systems could be developed with this set of characteristics.
