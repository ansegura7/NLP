Programmability of Intelligent Agent Avatars In this paper, we propose an approach to the programmability of intelligent agent avatars, supported by the distributed logic programming language DLP. Intelligent agent avatars can be considered as one of the applications of web agents. As one of the testbeds of 3D web agents, we are developing and implementing soccer playing avatars. We discuss how the language DLP can be used to support soccer playing avatars using rules to guide their behaviors in networked virtual environments.
