What can Partitioning do for your Data Warehouses and Data Marts? Efficient query processing is a critical requirement for data warehousing systems as decision support  applications often require minimum response times to answer complex, ad-hoc queries having aggregations,  multi-ways joins over vast repositories of data. This can be achieved by fragmenting warehouse  data. The data fragmentation concept in the context of distributed databases aims to reduce query  execution time and facilitates the parallel execution of queries. In this paper, we propose a methodology  for applying the fragmentation technique in a Data Warehouse (DW) star schema to reduce the total  query execution cost. We present an algorithm for fragmenting the tables of a star schema. During  the fragmentation process, we observe that the choice of the dimension tables used in fragmenting the  fact table plays an important role on overall performance. Therefore, we develop a greedy algorithm in  selecting "best" dimension tables. We propose an analytical cost model for executing a set of OLAP  queries on a fragmented star schema. Finally, we conduct some experiments to evaluate the utility of  fragmentation for efficiently executing OLAP queries.
