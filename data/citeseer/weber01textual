A Textual Case-Based Reasoning Framework for Knowledge Management Applications Knowledge management (KM) systems manipulate organizational  knowledge by storing and redistributing corporate memories that are acquired  from the organization's members. In this paper, we introduce a textual casebased  reasoning (TCBR) framework for KM systems that manipulates  organizational knowledge embedded in artifacts (e.g., best practices, alerts,  lessons learned). The TCBR approach acquires knowledge from human users  (via knowledge elicitation) and from text documents (via knowledge extraction)  using template-based information extraction methods, a subset of natural  language, and a domain ontology. Organizational knowledge is stored in a case  base and is distributed in the context of targeted processes (i.e., within external  distribution systems). The knowledge artifacts in the case base have to be  translated into the format of the external distribution systems. A domain  ontology supports knowledge elicitation and extraction, storage of knowledge  artifacts in a case base, and artifact translation.
