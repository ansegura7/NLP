Using Plan Recognition in Human-Computer Collaboration . Human-computer collaboration provides a practical and useful application for  plan recognition techniques. We describe a plan recognition algorithm which is tractable by  virtue of exploiting properties of the collaborative setting, namely: the focus of attention, the  use of partially elaborated hierarchical plans, and the possibility of asking for clarification.  We demonstrate how the addition of our plan recognition algorithm to an implemented  collaborative system reduces the amount of communication required from the user.  1 Introduction  An important trend in recent work on human-computer interaction and user modeling has been to view human-computer interaction as a kind of collaboration (e.g, Ferguson and Allen, 1998, Guinn, 1996, Rich and Sidner, 1998, Rickel and Johnson, 1998). In this approach, the human user and the computer (often personified as an "agent") coordinate their actions toward achieving shared goals. A common setting for collaboration, illustrated in Figure 1...
