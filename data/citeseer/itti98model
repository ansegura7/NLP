A Model of Saliency-based Visual Attention for Rapid Scene Analysis A visual attention system, inspired by the behavior and the neuronal architecture of the early primate visual system, is presented. Multiscale image features are combined into a single topographical saliency map. A dynamical neural network then selects attended locations in order of decreasing saliency. The system breaks down the complex problem of scene understanding by rapidly selecting, in a computationally efficient manner, conspicuous locations to be analyzed in detail. Index terms: Visual attention, scene analysis, feature extraction, target detection, visual search. \Pi I. Introduction Primates have a remarkable ability to interpret complex scenes in real time, despite the limited speed of the neuronal hardware available for such tasks. Intermediate and higher visual processes appear to select a subset of the available sensory information before further processing [1], most likely to reduce the complexity of scene analysis [2]. This selection appears to be implemented in the ...
