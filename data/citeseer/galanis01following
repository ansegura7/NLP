Following the paths of XML Data: An algebraic framework for XML query evaluation This paper introduces an algebraic framework for expressing and evaluating queries over XML data.  It presents the underlying assumptions of the framework, describes the input and output of the algebraic  operators, and defines these operators and their semantics. It evaluates the framework with regard to  other proposed XML query algebras. Examples show that this framework is flexible enough to capture  queries expressed in Quilt, one of the dominant XML query languages. We have used this algebra in the  context of an Internet query engine, in which it is used to formulate logical plans for XML-QL queries.  We define equivalence rules that provide opportunities for optimization, and give example cases that  point out the usefulness of these rules.  1
