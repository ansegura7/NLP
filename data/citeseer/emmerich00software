Software Engineering and Middleware: A Roadmap The construction of a large class of distributed systems can be simplified by leveraging middleware, which is layered between network operating systems and application components. Middleware resolves heterogeneity, and facilitates communication and coordination of distributed components. State of-the-practice middleware products enable software engineers to build systems that are distributed across a localarea network. State-of-the-art middleware research aims to push this boundary towards Internet-scale distribution, adaptive systems, middleware for dependable and wireless systems. The challenge for software engineering research is to devise notations, techniques, methods and tools for distributed system construction that systematically build and exploit the capabilities that middleware products deliver, now and in the future.
