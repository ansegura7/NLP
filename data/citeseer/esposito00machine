Machine Learning for Intelligent Processing of Printed Documents . A paper document processing system is an information system component which transforms information on printed or handwritten documents into a computer-revisable form. In intelligent systems for paper document processing this information capture process is based on knowledge of the speci#c layout and logical structures of the documents. This article proposes the application of machine learning techniques to acquire the speci#c knowledge required byan  intelligent document processing system, named WISDOM++, that manages printed documents, such as letters and journals. Knowledge is represented by means of decision trees and #rst-order rules automatically generated from a set of training documents. In particular, an incremental decision tree learning system is applied for the acquisition of decision trees used for the classi- #cation of segmented blocks, while a #rst-order learning system is applied for the induction of rules used for the layout-based classi#cation and understanding of d...
