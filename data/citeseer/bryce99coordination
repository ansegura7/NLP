A Coordination Model for Agents based on Secure Spaces . Shared space coordination models such as Linda are ill-suited  for structuring applications composed of erroneous or insecure components.  This paper presents the Secure Object Space model. In this model,  a data element can be locked with a key and is only visible to a process  that presents a matching key to unlock the element. We give a precise  semantics for Secure Object Space operations and discuss an implementation  in Java for a mobile agent system. An implementation of the  semantics that employs encryption is also outlined for use in untrusted  environments.  1 Introduction  Coordination languages based on shared data spaces have been around for over fifteen years. Researchers have often advocated their use for structuring distributed and concurrent systems because the mode of communication that they provide, sometimes called generative communication, is associative and uncoupled. Communication is associative in that processes do not explicitly name their communication part...
