The RoboCup Synthetic Agent Challenge 97 RoboCup Challenge offers a set of challenges for intelligent agent researchers using a friendly competition in a dynamic, real-time, multiagent domain. While RoboCup in general envisions longer range challenges over the next few decades, RoboCup Challenge presents three specific challenges for the next two years: (i) learning of individual agents and teams; (ii) multi-agent team planning and plan-execution in service of teamwork; and (iii) opponent modeling. RoboCup Challenge provides a novel opportunity for machine learning, planning, and multi-agent researchers --- it not only supplies a concrete domain to evalute their techniques, but also challenges researchers to evolve these techniques to face key constraints fundamental to this domain: real-time, uncertainty, and teamwork.  1 Introduction  RoboCup (The World Cup Robot Soccer) is an attempt to promote AI and robotics research by providing a common task, Soccer, for evaluation of various theories, algorithms, and agent architectur...
