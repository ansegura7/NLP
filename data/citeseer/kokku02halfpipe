Half-pipe Anchoring: An Efficient Technique for Multiple Connection Handoff This paper presents Half--pipe anchoring, a novel technique to build a multiple connection handoff  mechanism that enables efficient use of resources in a server cluster, improves the scalability of  the cluster and supports construction of heterogeneous cluster architectures where nodes are specialized  to perform specific tasks of client requests efficiently. The key idea behind our approach is  to decouple the two unidirectional half-pipes that make up a TCP connection between a client and  a server and anchor the unidirectional half--pipe from the client to the cluster at a designated server  while allowing the half--pipe from the cluster to the client to migrate on a per--request basis to an  optimal server where the request is best serviced. We describe the design and implementation of a  prototype multiple connection handoff mechanism in the Linux kernel and demonstrate the benefits  of our technique.
