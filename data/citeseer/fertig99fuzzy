A Fuzzy Beam-Search Rule Induction Algorithm . This paper proposes a fuzzy beam search rule induction algorithm for the classification task. The use of fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets not only provides us with a powerful, flexible approach to cope with uncertainty, but also allows us to express the discovered rules in a representation more intuitive and comprehensible for the user, by using linguistic terms (such as low, medium, high) rather than continuous, numeric values in rule conditions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in two public domain data sets. 1 Introduction  This paper addresses the classification task. In this task the goal is to discover a relationship between a goal attribute, whose value is to be predicted, and a set of predicting attributes. The system discovers this relationship by using known-class examples, and the discovered relationship is then used to predict the goal-attribute value (or the class) of unknown-class examples. There are numerous rule induction algorithms for the classification task. However, ...
