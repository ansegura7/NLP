The View Holder Approach: Utilizing Customized Materialized Views To Create Database Services Suitable For Mobile Database Applications among mobile devices (i.e., a laptop vs. a pager) and the amount of information available from today's database environments and the Internet.  To this end, this dissertation presents the development of customizable view maintenance services, called the View Holder approach, whose middleware mechanism within the fixed network dynamically maintains versions of the views so that to meet the data consistency and currency requirements of a particular mobile client. In a general form, a View Holder can support a community of mobile clients with common interests. The motivation for maintaining versions is to compensate for the data changes that occurred to the materialized views that were used during disconnection as well as to reduce the cost of wireless communication. In order to maintain these views, customized view maintenance is performed at the data sources by translating the mobile machine's request into a materialization program containing a triggering
