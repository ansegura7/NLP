The NLP layer incorporates morphological analysis, noun phrase syntax, and semantic expansion based on WordNet.  1 Introduction  This paper describes a layered approach to information retrieval, and the natural language component that is a major element in that approach. The layered approach, packaged as Intermezzo  TM  , was deployed in a pre-product form at a government site.
