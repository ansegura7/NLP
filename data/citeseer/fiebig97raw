RAW: A Relational Algebra for the Web The main idea underlying the paper is to extend the relational algebra such that it becomes possible to process queries against the World-Wide Web. These extensions are minor in that we tried to keep them at the domain level. Additionally to the known domains (int, bool, float, string), we introduce three new domains to deal with URLs, html-documents or fragments thereof, and path expressions. Over these domains we define several functions that are accessible from the algebra within the subscripts of the relational operators. The approach allows us to reuse the operators of the relational algebra without major modifications. Indead, the only extension necessary is the introduction of a map operator. Further, two modifications to the scan and the indexscan are necessary. Finally, the indexscan which has the functionality of a typical meta-search engine is capable of computing a unified rank based on the tuple order provided by the underlying search engines. 1 Introduction  The Web [2] w...
