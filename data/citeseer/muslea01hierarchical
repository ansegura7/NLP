Hierarchical Wrapper Induction for Semistructured Information Sources With the tremendous amount of information that becomes available on the Web on a daily basis, the abilitytoquickly develop information agents has become a crucial problem. A vital componentofanyWeb-based information agent is a set of wrappers that can extract the relevant data from semistructured information sources. Our novel approach to wrapper induction is based on the idea of hierarchical information extraction, which turns the hard problem of extracting data from an arbitrarily complex documentinto a series of simpler extraction tasks. We introduce an inductive algorithm, stalker, that generates high accuracy extraction rules based on user-labeled training examples. Labeling the training data represents the major bottleneck in using wrapper induction techniques, and our experimental results showthatstalker requires up to two orders of magnitude fewer examples than other algorithms. Furthermore,    can wrap information sources that could not be wrapped by existing inductivetechniques.
