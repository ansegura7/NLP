A Wearable Computer System with Augmented Reality to Support Terrestrial Navigation To date augmented realities are typically operated in only a small defined area, in the order of a large room. This paper reports on our investigation into expanding augmented realities to outdoor environments. The project entails providing visual navigation aids to users. Awearable computer system with a see-through display, digital compass, and a differential GPS are used to provide visual cues while performing a standard orienteering task. This paper reports the outcomes of a set of trials using an off the shelf wearable computer, equipped with a custom built navigation software package, "map-in-the-hat."
