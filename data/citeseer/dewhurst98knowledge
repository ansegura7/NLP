Knowledge Discovery from Client-Server Databases . The subject of this paper is the implementation of knowledge discovery in databases. Specifically, we assess the requirements for interfacing tools to client-server database systems in view of the architecture of those systems and of "knowledge discovery processes". We introduce the concept of a query frontier of an exploratory process, and propose a strategy based on optimizing the current query frontier rather than individual knowledge discovery algorithms. This approach has the advantage of enhanced genericity and interoperability. We demonstrate a small set of query primitives, and show how one example tool, the well-known decision tree induction algorithm C4.5, can be rewritten to function in this environment. 1 Introduction  Relational databases are the current dominant database technology in industry, and many organizations have collected large amounts of data in so-called  data warehouses expressly for the purpose of decision support and data mining. In general the data must ...
