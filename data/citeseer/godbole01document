Document Classification as an Internet service: Choosing the best classifier This project investigates some of the issues involved in a new proposal for expanding the scope of the field of Data Mining by providing mining models as services on the Internet. This idea can widely increase the reach and accessibility of Data Mining to common people because one of the primary stumbling blocks in the adoption of mining is the extremely high level of expertise and data resources needed in building a robust mining model. We feel this task should be left to the specialists with access to data and resources, who can provide their most up to date model as a service on the Internet for public use.
