Distributed Reflective Architectures The autonomy of a system can be defined as its capability to recover from unforeseen  difficulties without any user intervention. This thesis proposal addresses a small part of  this problem, namely the detection of anomalies within a system's own operation by the  system itself. It is a response to a challenge presented by immune systems which can  distinguish between "self" and "nonself", i.e. they can recognise a "foreign" pattern (due  to a virus or bacterium) as different from those associated with the organism itself, even  if the pattern was not previously encountered. The aim is to apply this requirement to  an artificial system, where "nonself" may be any form of deliberate intrusion or random  anomalous behaviour due to a fault.  When designing reflective architectures or self-diagnostic systems, it is simpler to rely  on a single coordination mechanism to make the system work as intended. However, such  a coordination mechanism cannot be inspected or repaired by the system i...
