Algorithm for Optimal Winner Determination in Combinatorial Auctions Combinatorial auctions, i.e. auctions where bidders can bid on com-binations of items, tend to lead to more e cient allocations than tra-ditional auctions in multi-item auctions where the agents ' valuations of the items are not additive. However, determining the winners so as to maximize revenue is NP-complete. First, existing approaches for tackling this problem are reviewed: exhaustive enumeration, dynamic programming, approximation algorithms, and restricting the allow-able combinations. Then we present our search algorithm for optimal winner determination. Experiments are shown on several bid distri-butions. The algorithm allows combinatorial auctions to scale up to signi cantly larger numbers of items and bids than prior approaches to optimal winner determination by capitalizing on the fact that the space of bids is necessarily sparsely populated in practice. The algo-rithm does this by provably su cient selective generation of children in the search tree, by using a secondary search for fast child genera-tion, by heuristics that are accurate and optimized for speed, and by four methods for preprocessing the search space. Patent pending. A highly optimized implementation of the algorithm is available for licensing both for research and commercial purposes. Please contact the author. 1 1
