A Tableau-Based Proof Method for Temporal Logics of Knowledge and Belief . In this paper we define two logics, KLn and BLn , and present tableau-based decision procedures for both. KLn is a temporal logic of knowledge. Thus, in addition to the usual connectives of linear discrete temporal logic, it contains a set of unary modal connectives for representing the knowledge  possessed by agents. The logic BLn is somewhat similar; it is a temporal logic that contains connectives for representing the beliefs of agents. In addition to a complete formal definition of the two logics and their decision procedures, the paper includes a brief review of their applications in AI and mainstream computer science, correctness proofs for the decision procedures, a number of worked examples illustrating the decision procedures, and some pointers to further work.  KEYWORDS:Temporal logics of knowledge and belief, theorem proving, tableau. 1 Introduction  This paper presents two logics, called KLn and BLn respectively, and gives tableau-based decision procedures for both. The l...
