Agent UML Class Diagrams Revisited Multiagent system designers already use Agent UML in order to represent the interaction protocols [8] [2]. Agent UML is a graphical modeling language based on UML. As UML, Agent UML provides several types of representation covering the description of the system, of the components, the dynamics of the system and the deployment. Since agents and objects are not exactly the same, one can guess that the UML class diagram has to be changed for describing agents. The aim of this paper is to present how to extend Agent UML class diagrams in order to represent agents. We then compare our approach to Bauer's approach [1].
