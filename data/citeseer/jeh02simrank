SimRank: A Measure of Structural-Context Similarity The problem of measuring "similarity" of objects arises in  many applications, and many domain-specific measures  have been developed, e.g., matching text across documents  or computing overlap among item-sets. We propose  a complementary approach, applicable in any domain  with object-to-object relationships, that measures similarity  of the structural context in which objects occur, based  on their relationships with other objects. Effectively, we  compute a measure that says "two objects are similar if  they are related to similar objects." This general similarity  measure, called SimRank, is based on a simple and intuitive  graph-theoretic model. For a given domain, SimRank  can be combined with other domain-specific similarity  measures. We suggest techniques for efficient computation  of SimRank scores, and provide experimental results  on two application domains showing the computational  feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.
