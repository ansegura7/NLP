Web Search -- Your Way We describe a metasearch engine architecture, in use at NEC Research Institute, that allows users to provide preferences in the form of an information need category. This extra information is used to direct the search process, providing more valuable results than by considering only the query. Using our architecture, identical keyword queries may be sent to different search engines, and results may be scored differently for different users.
