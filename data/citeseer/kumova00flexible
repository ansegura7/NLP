Flexible Distributed Database Management with AgentTeam . Ideally, distributed management of relational data should enable the sharing of consistent data and provide system transparency. In contrast to information retrieval, users can access compact data and utilise it for further relational processing. However, distributed database management is still a challenging research area that involves bridging syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of data as well as of functionality. Since, existing distributed database management systems were usually built with a focus on the implementation of some dedicated protocols for distributed database management, they are inflexible for major modifications or exchange of the protocols. In addition, their software architecture usually does not comply with well-known design paradigms, which could facilitate the maintenance of the software system. We present an agent-based approach for flexible distributed database management, where independent distributed database management protocols and methods are...
