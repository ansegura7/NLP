An Experimental CLP Platform for Integrity Constraints and Abduction Integrity constraint and abduction are important in query-answering systems for enhanced query processing and for expressing knowledge in databases. A straightforward characterization of the two is given in a subset of the language CHR  _  , originally intended for writing constraint solvers to be applied for CLP languages. This subset has a strikingly simple computational model that can be executed using existing, Prolog-based technology. Together with earlier results, this confirms CHR  _  as a multiparadigm platform for experimenting with combinations of top-down and bottom-up evaluation, disjunctive databases and, as shown here, integrity constraint and abduction  1 Introduction  Constraint logic programming (CLP) [10] is established as an extension to logic programming that adds higher expressibility and in some cases more efficient query evaluation. CLP has also given rise to a field of constraint databases [14].  In the present paper, we suggest CLP techniques applied for defini...
