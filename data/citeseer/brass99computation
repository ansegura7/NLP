Computation of the Semantics of Autoepistemic Belief Theories Recently, one of the authors introduced a simple and yet powerful non-monotonic knowledge representation framework, called the Autoepistemic Logic of Beliefs, AEB. Theories in AEB are called autoepistemic belief theories. Every belief theory  T has been shown to have the least static expansion T which is computed by iterating a natural monotonic belief closure operator \Psi T starting from T . This way, the least static expansion T of any belief theory provides its natural non-monotonic semantics which is called the static semantics.  It is easy to see that if a belief theory T is finite then the construction of its least static expansion T stops after countably many iterations. However, a somewhat surprising result obtained in this paper shows that the least static expansion of any finite belief theory T is in fact obtained by means of a single iteration of the belief closure operator \Psi T (although this requires T to be of a special form, we also show that T can be always put in th...
