Designing a Digital Library for Young Children: An Intergenerational Partnership As more information resources become accessible using computers, our digital interfaces to those resources need to be appropriate for all people. However when it comes to digital libraries, the interfaces have typically been designed for older children or adults. Therefore, we have begun to develop a digital library interface developmentally appropriate for young children (ages 5-10 years old). Our prototype system we now call "QueryKids" offers a graphical interface for querying, browsing and reviewing search results. This paper describes our motivation for the research, the design partnership we established between children and adults, our design process, the technology outcomes of our current work, and the lessons we have  learned.  Keywords  Children, digital libraries, information retrieval design techniques, education applications, participatory design, cooperative inquiry, intergenerational design team, zoomable user interfaces (ZUIs).  THE NEED FOR RESEARCH  A growing body of k...
