Constrained Nearest Neighbor Queries In this paper we introduce the notion of constrained nearest neighbor queries (CNN) and propose a  series of methods to answer them. This class of queries can be thought of as nearest neighbor queries with  range constraints. Although both nearest neighbor and range queries have been analyzed extensively in  previous literature, the implications of constrained nearest neighbor queries have not been discussed. Due  to their versatility, CNN queries are suitable to a wide range of applications from GIS systems to reverse  nearest neighbor queries and multimedia applications. We develop methods for answering CNN queries  with different properties and advantages. We prove the optimality (with respect to I/O cost) of one of the  techniques proposed in this paper. The superiority of the proposed technique is shown by a performance  analysis.  1 Introduction  Two dimensional range queries are used frequently in various applications such as spatial databases [Sam89,  GG98] and Geographic Infor...
