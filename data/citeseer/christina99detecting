Detecting Intrusions Using System Calls: Alternative Data Models Intrusion detection systems rely on a wide variety of observable data to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate activities. In this paper we study one such observable---sequences of system calls into the kernel of an operating system. Using system-call data sets generated by several different programs, each consisting both of normal and intrusive behavior, we compare the ability of different data-modeling methods to represent normal behavior accurately and to recognize intrusions. We compare the following methods: simple enumeration of observed sequences, methods based on relative frequencies of different sequences, a data mining technique, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). All of the methods perform adequately, with HMMs giving the best overall results. We discuss the factors affecting the performance of each method, and conclude that for this particular problem, weaker methods than HMMs are likely sufficient.  1 Introduction  In 1996, Forrest and others introduced a simple in...
