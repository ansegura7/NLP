A Synthetic Agent System for Bayesian Modeling Human Interactions When building statistical machine learning models from real data one of the most frequently encountered difficulties is the limited amount of training data compared to what is needed by the specific learning architecture. In order to deal with this problem we have developed a synthetic (simulated) agent training system that let us develop flexible prior models for recognizing human interactions in a pedestrian visual surveillance task. We demonstrate the ability to use these prior models to accurately classify real human behaviors and interactions with no additional tuning or training. 1 Introduction  Agent-based solutions have been developed for many different application domains, and field-tested agent systems are steadily increasing in number. Agents are currently being applied in domains as diverse as computer games and interactive cinema, information retrieval and filtering, user interface design, electronic commerce, and industrial process control. In this paper we propose a nove...
