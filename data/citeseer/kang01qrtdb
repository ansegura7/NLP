qRTDB: Qos-Sensitive Real-Time Database Introduction  Recently the demand for real-time database services is exploding. The applications requiring such services include sensor data fusion, decision support, web information service, e-commerce, online trading, and dataintensive smart space applications. Furthermore, the information system is being globalized due to the fast growth of the Internet. Despite the importance and wide applicability, the performance and predictability of a database system    \Gamma the core component of global information systems \Gamma are relatively limited compared to the other real-time systems such as real-time operating systems. It can not be easily replicated due to the consistency problem. In addition, the database system has relatively low predictability compared to other real-time systems due to data dependence of the transaction execution, data and resource conflicts, dynamic paging and I/O, and transaction aborts and the resulting rollbacks and restarts [36]. Because of the limited perfo
