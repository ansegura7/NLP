The Smart Floor: A Mechanism for Natural User Identification and Tracking We have created a system for identifying people based on their footstep force profiles and have tested its accuracy against a large pool of footstep data. This floor system may be used to identify users transparently in their everyday living and working environments. We have created user footstep models based on footstep profile features and have been able to achieve a recognition rate of 93%. We have also shown that the effect of footwear is negligible on recognition accuracy.  Keywords  Interaction technology, ubiquitous computing, user identification, biometrics, novel input.  INTRODUCTION  In the Smart Floor project, we have created and validated a system for biometric user identification based on footstep profiles. We have outfitted a floor tile with force measuring sensors and are using the data gathered as users walk over the tile to identify them. We rely on the uniqueness of footstep profiles within a small group of people to provide recognition accuracy similar to other biome...
