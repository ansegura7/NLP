Synthesis And Adaptation Of Multiagent Communication Protocols In The Production Engineering Domain The application of multiagent systems is often based on the claim that there will be an emergent behavior within these systems. To reach the emergent behavior many researcher propagate to plan it within design and analysis of specific systems, as it will not occur by chance.  We are presenting a new way to adaptive agent communication protocols with respect to a possible gain of emergent behavior. Communication protocols can be generated, refined or adapted by the agents autonomously. The approach uses basic concepts of machine learning.
