Detection and Tracking of Facial Features in Video Sequences . This work presents a real time system for detection and tracking of facial  features in video sequences. Such system may be used in visual communication  applications, such as teleconferencing, virtual reality, intelligent interfaces, humanmachine  interaction, surveillance, etc. We have used a statistical skin-color model to  segment face-candidate regions in the image. The presence or absence of a face in  each region is verified by means of an eye detector, based on an efficient template  matching scheme . Once a face is detected, the pupils, nostrils and lip corners are  located and these facial features are tracked in the image sequence, performing real  time processing.  1
