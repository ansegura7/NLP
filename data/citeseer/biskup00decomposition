Decomposition of Database Classes under Path Functional Dependencies and Onto Constraints Based on F-logic, we specify an advanced data model with object-oriented and  logic-oriented features that substantially extend the relational approach. For this  model we exhibit and study the counterpart to the well-known decomposition of  a relation scheme according to a nontrivial nonkey functional dependency. For  decomposing a class of a database schema the transformation of pivoting is used.  Pivoting separates apart some attributes of the class into a newly generated class.  This new class is declared to be a subclass of the result class of the so-called pivot  attribute. Moreover the pivot attribute provides the link between the original class  and the new subclass. We identify the conditions for the result of pivoting being  equivalent with its input: the expressive power of path functional dependencies,  the validity of the path functional dependency between the pivot attribute and  the transplanted attributes, and the validity of the onto-constraint guaranteeing  that value...
