Similarity Query Processing in Image Databases CHITRA is a prototype CBIR system we are building. It uses a four layer data model we have developed, and enables retrieval based on high level concepts, such as "retrieve images of MOUNTAINS", and "retrieve images of MOUNTAINS and SUNSET". This paper deals with some issues about query processing encountered in the implementation of the system. The contributions of this paper can be summarized in terms of processing the following four example queries (I 1 , I 2 , ..,I k are images).  Q 1 : "retrieve images similar to I 1 based on color".  Q 2 : "retrieve images similar to I 1 based on color AND texture".  Q 3 : "retrieve images similar to I 1 ; I 2 ; ::; I k based on color".  Q 4 : "retrieve images similar to I 1 ; I 2 ; ::; I k based on color AND texture".  First a brief review of basic CBIR query processing literature is provided (processing of Q 1 ). Processing of Q 2 involves efficient evaluation of combining functions, a problem that has attracted research attention in recent time...
