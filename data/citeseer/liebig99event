Event Composition in Time-dependent Distributed Systems Many interesting application systems, ranging from workflow  management and CSCW to air traffic control, are eventdriven  and time-dependent and must interact with heterogeneous  components in the real world. Event services are used  to glue together distributed components. They assume a virtual  global time base to trigger actions and to order events.  The notion of a global time that is provided by synchronized  local clocks in distributed systems has a fundamental impact  on the semantics of event-driven systems, especially the composition  of events. The well studied 2g-precedence model,  which assumes that the granularity of global time-base g can  be derived from a priori known and bounded precision of  local clocks may not be suitable for the Internet where the  accuracy and external synchronization of local clocks is best  effort and cannot be guaranteed because of large transmission  delay variations and phases of disconnection. In this  paper we introduce a mechanism based on...
