An Extensible Framework for Data Cleaning Data integration solutions dealing with large amounts of data have been strongly required in the last few years.  Besides the traditional data integration problems (e.g. schema integration, local to global schema mappings),  three additional data problems have to be dealt with: (1) the absence of universal keys across dierent databases  that is known as the object identity problem, (2) the existence of keyboard errors in the data, and (3) the presence  of inconsistencies in data coming from multiple sources. Dealing with these problems is globally called the data  cleaning process. In this work, we propose a framework which oers the fundamental services required by this  process: data transformation, duplicate elimination and multi-table matching. These services are implemented  using a set of purposely designed macro-operators. Moreover, we propose an SQL extension for specifying  each of the macro-operators. One important feature of the framework is the ability of explicitly includ...
