A Search Engine for 3D Models As the number of 3D models available on the Web grows, there is an increasing need for a  search engine to help people find them. Unfortunately, traditional text-based search techniques  are not always effective for 3D data. In this paper, we investigate new shape-based search  methods. The key challenges are to develop query methods simple enough for novice users  and matching algorithms robust enough to work for arbitrary polygonal models. We present a  web-based search engine system that supports queries based on 3D sketches, 2D sketches, 3D  models, and/or text keywords. For the shape-based queries, we have developed a new matching  algorithm that uses spherical harmonics to compute discriminating similarity measures without  requiring repair of model degeneracies or alignment of orientations. It provides 46--245%  better performance than related shape matching methods during precision-recall experiments,  and it is fast enough to return query results from a repository of 20,000 models in under a  second. The net result is a growing interactive index of 3D models available on the Web (i.e.,  a Google for 3D models).
