Expert System Technology in Observing Tools Over the past two years, the Scientist's Expert Assistant team from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute has been prototyping tools to support General Observer proposal development for the Hubble Space Telescope and the Next Generation Space Telescope. One aspect of this effort has been the exploration of the use of expert systems in guiding the user in preparing their observing program. The initial goal was to provide the user with a question-and-answer style of interaction where the software would "interview" the user for their science needs and recommend instrument settings. This design ultimately failed. The reasons for this failure, and the resulting evolution of our approach, are an interesting case study in the use of expert system technology for observing tools. Although the interview approach failed we felt that expert systems can still be used in the tools environment. This paper describes our current approach to the use of expert syste...
