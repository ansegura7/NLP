Cost-Based Optimization of Decision Support Queries using Transient-Views Next generation decision support applications, besides being capable of processing huge amounts of data, require the ability to integrate and reason over data from multiple, heterogeneous data sources. Often, these data sources differ in a variety of aspects such as their data models, the query languages they support, and their network protocols. Also, typically they are spread over a wide geographical area. The cost of processing decision support queries in such a setting is quite high. However, processing these queries often involves redundancies such as repeated access of same data source and multiple execution of similar processing sequences. Minimizing these redundancies would significantly reduce the query processing cost. In this paper, we (1) propose an architecture for processing complex decision support queries involving multiple, heterogeneous data sources
