Roomware for Cooperative Buildings: Integrated Design of Architectural Spaces and Information Spaces . In this paper, we introduce the concepts of "cooperative buildings" and  "roomware" and place them in the context of the integrated design of real, physical,  resp. architectural spaces and virtual, resp. digital information spaces. By "roomware  " we mean computer-augmented things in rooms, like doors, walls, furniture,  and others. The general approach is detailed via examples from the i-LAND project  where we develop several "roomware" components in order to realize an interactive  information and cooperation landscape, e.g. an innovative work environment for  creativity teams. We describe the current realization of i-LAND which includes an  interactive electronic wall, an interactive table, computer-augmented chairs, and a  mechanism for assigning physical objects as representatives of information objects  in the virtual world.  Keywords. cooperative buildings, shared workspaces, physical space, architecture,  virtual world, information space, augmented reality, roomware, furnitu...
