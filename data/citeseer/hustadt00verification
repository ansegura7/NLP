Verification within the KARO Agent Theory Abstract. This paper discusses automated reasoning in the KARO framework. The KARO framework accommodates a range of expressive modal logics for describing the behaviour of intelligent agents. We concentrate on a core logic within this framework, in particular, we describe two new methods for providing proof methods for this core logic, discuss some of the problems we have encountered in their design, and present an extended example of the use of the KARO framework and the two proof methods. 1
