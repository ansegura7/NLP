Comparing Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in DataBases: An Application to Knowledge Discovery in Texts INTRODUCTION  KDD is better known by the oversimplified name of Data Mining (DM). Actually, most academics are rather interested by DM which develops methods for extracting knowledge from a given set of data. Industrialists and experts should be more interested in KDD which comprises the whole process of data selection, data cleaning, transfer to a DM technique, applying the DM technique, validating the results of the DM technique, and finally interpreting them for the user. In general, this process is a cycle that improves under the criticism of the expert.  Machine Learning (ML) and KDD have in common a very strong link : they both acknowledge the importance of induction as a normal way of thinking, while other scientific fields are reluctant to accept it, to say the least. We shall first explore this common point. We believe that this reluctance relies on a misuse of apparent contradictions inside the theory of confirmation, that is we shall revisit Hempel paradox in order t
