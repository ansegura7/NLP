The Gateway System: Uniform Web Based Access to Remote Resources Exploiting our experience developing the WebFlow system, we designed the Gateway system to provide seamless and secure access to computational resources at ASC MSRC. The Gateway follows our commodity components strategy, and it is implemented as a modern three-tier system. Tier 1 is a highlevel front end for visual programming, steering, run-time data analysis and visualization that is built on top of the Web and OO commodity standards. Distributed object-based, scalable, and reusable Web server and Object broker middleware forms Tier 2. Back-end services comprise Tier 3. In particular, access to high-performance computational resources is provided by implementing the emerging standard for metacomputing API.  1. Introduction  The last few years have seen the growing power and capability of commodity computing and communication technologies largely driven by commercial distributed information systems. All of them can be abstracted to a three-tier model with largely independent clients c...
