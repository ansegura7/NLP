Superimposing Codes Representing Hierarchical Information in Web directories In this article we describe how superimposed coding can be used  to represent hierarchical information, which is especially useful in categorized information retrieval systems (for example, Web  directories). Superimposed coding have been widely used in  signature files in a rigid manner, but our approach is more flexible and powerful. The categorization is based on a directed acyclic  graph and each document is assigned to one or more nodes, using  superimposed coding we represent the categorization information  of each document in a signature. In this paper we explain the  superimposed coding theory and how this coding technique can  be applied to more flexible environments. Furthermore, we realize an exhaustive analysis of the important factors that have  repercussions on the performance of the system. Finally we  expose the conclusions obtained from this article.
