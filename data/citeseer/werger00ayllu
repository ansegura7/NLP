Ayllu: Distributed Port-Arbitrated Behavior-Based Control . Distributed control of a team of mobile robots presents a number of unique challenges, including highly unreliable communication, real world task and safety constraints, scalability, dynamic reconfigurability, heterogenous platforms, and a lack of standardized tools or techniques. Similar problems plagued development of single robots applications until the "behavior-based" revolution led to new techniques for robot control based on port-arbitrated behaviors (PAB). Though there are now many implementations of systems for behavior-based control of single robots, the potential for distributing such control across robots for multi-agent control has not until now been fully realized.  This paper presents Ayllu, a system for distributed multi-robot behavioral control. Ayllu allows standard PAB interaction (message passing, inhibition, and suppression) to take place over IP networks, and extends the PAB paradigm to provide for arbitrary scalability. We give a brief overview of the Broadcast...
