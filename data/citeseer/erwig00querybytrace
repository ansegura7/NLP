Query-By-Trace: Visual Predicate Specification In Spatio-Temporal Databases In this paper we propose a visual interface for the specification of predicates to be used in queries on spatio-temporal databases. The approach is based on a visual specification method for temporally changing spatial situations. This extends existing concepts for visual spatial query languages, which are only capable of querying static spatial situations. We outline a preliminary user interface that supports the specification on an intuitive and easily manageable level, and we describe the design of the underlying visual language. The visual notation can be used directly as a visual query interface to spatio-temporal databases, or it can provide predicate specifications that can be integrated into textual query languages leading to heterogeneous languages. Key Words Spatio-Temporal Queries, Visual Predicate Specification, Visual Database Interface 1. INTRODUCTION Spatio-temporal databases deal with spatial objects that change over time (for example, they move or they grow): cars, ...
