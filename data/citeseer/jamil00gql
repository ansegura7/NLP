GQL: A Reasonable Complex SQL for Genomic Databases Validating hypotheses and reasoning about objects is becoming commonplace in biotechnology research. The capability to reason strengthens comparative genomics research by providing the much needed tool to pose intelligent queries in a more convenient and declarative fashion. To be able to reason using Genomic Query Language (GQL), we propose the idea of parameterized views as an extension of SQL's create view construct with an optional with parameter clause. Parameterizing enables traditional SQL views to accept input values and delay the computation of the view until invoked with a call statement. This extension empowers users with the capability of modifying the behavior of predened procedures (views) by sending arguments and evaluating the procedure on demand. We demonstrate that the extension is soundly based, with a parallel in Datalog. We also show that the idea of relational unication proposed here empowers SQL to reason and infer in exactly the same way as an Object-Oriented ...
