Open video: A framework for a test collection This paper provides a framework for such a test collection and describes the Open  Video Project that has begun to develop a test collection based on this framework. The  proposed test collection is meant to be used to study a wide range of problems, such  as tests of algorithms for creating surrogates for video content or interfaces that display  result sets from queries. An important challenge in developing such a collection is storing  and distributing video objects. This paper is meant to layout video management issues  that may influence distributed storage solutions. More specifically, this paper describes  the first phase for creating the test collection, sets guidelines for building the collection,  and serves as a basis for discussion to inform subsequent phases and invite research  community involvement.  2000 Academic Press  1. Introduction  It is inevitable that the technical limitations that impede widespread usage of video libraries will dimi
