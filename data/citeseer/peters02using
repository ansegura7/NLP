Using Semantic Networks for Knowledge Representation in an Intelligent Environment Introduction  For many years now, research in intelligent spaces has grown, exploring different ways that a room can react to one or more users and their actions. As usage of these intelligent environments (IEs) grows, however, they will by necessity collect ever-increasing amounts of data about their users, in order to adapt to the user's desires. Information will be collected on the users' interests, who they communicate with, their location, web pages they visit, and numerous other details that we may not even notice. All this information needs to be collected and organized, so that the IE can make quick, correct assumptions about what the user would like to do next.  At the Intelligent Room project (Hanssens et al., 2002), we are beginning to define one such knowledge representation  (KR), using semantic networks as the basis for the representation. This creates inherent advantages, both in ease of adding and changing information as well as inference generation.  2. Knowledge Repre
