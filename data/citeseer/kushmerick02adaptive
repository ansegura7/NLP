Adaptive information extraction: Core technologies for information agents Introduction  For the purposes of this chapter, an information agent can be described as a distributed system that receives a goal through its user interface, gathers information relevant to this goal from a variety of sources, processes this content as appropriate, and delivers the results to the users. We focus on the second stage in this generic architecture. We survey a variety of information extraction techniques that enable information agents to automatically gather information from heterogeneous sources.  For example, consider an agent that mediates package-delivery requests. To satisfy such requests, the agent might need to retrieve address information from geographic services, ask an advertising service for freight forwarders that serve the destination, request quotes from the relevant freight forwarders, retrieve duties and legal constraints from government sites, get weather information to estimate transportation delays, etc.  Information extraction (IE) is a form of sh
