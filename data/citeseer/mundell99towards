Towards a Virtual Operating Environment - Exploring Immersive Virtual Interface Design Using a Simple VR Image Viewer This paper explores the virtual interface from a design perspective. A simple virtual reality image  viewer application is tested with a variety of users, producing a virtual interface design reference model,  and a set of virtual interface design guidelines.  2  Acknowledgements  A massive thank you to Shaun Bangay, my supervisor, for priceless guidance.
