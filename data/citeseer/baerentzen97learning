Learning Network Designs for Asynchronous Teams . An asynchronous team (A-Team) is a network of agents (workers) and memories (repositories for the results of work). It is possible to design A-Teams to be effective in solving difficult computational problems. The main design issues are: "What structure should the network have?" and "What should be the complement of agents?" In the past, the structure-issue was resolved by intuition and experiment. This paper describes a procedure by which good structures can be learned from experience. The procedure is based on the use of regular expressions for encoding the capabilities of networks. 1 Introduction  An Asynchronous Team (A-Team) is a problem solving architecture consisting of collections of agents and memories connected into a strongly cyclic directed network. The memories form the nodes of the network, the agents form the arcs. Figure 1 below shows such a network. Each memory holds a population of trial solutions. The solutions are not necessarily solutions to the overall problem t...
