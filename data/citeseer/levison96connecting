Connecting Planning And Acting Via Object-Specific Reasoning Instructions from a high-level planner are in general too abstract for a behavioral simulator to execute. In this dissertation I describe an intermediate reasoning system -- the Object-Specific Reasoner -- which bridges the gap between high-level task-actions and action directives of a behavioral system. It decomposes task-actions and derives parameter values for each action directive, thus enabling existing high-level planners to instruct synthetic agents with the same task-action commands that they currently produce. The Object-Specific Reasoner's architecture follows directly from the hypothesis that action representations are underspecified descriptions, and that objects in the same functional category are manipulated in similar ways. The action representation and the object representation are combined to complete the action interpretation, thereby grounding plans in action. The Object-Specific Reasoner provides evidence that a small number of object functional categories, organize...
