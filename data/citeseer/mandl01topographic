Topographic Maps Based on Kohonen Self Organizing Maps An Empirical Approach Two-dimensional maps are a valuable interface element for the visualization of information retrieval results or other large sets of objects. Various methods exist for the creation of these maps. This article describes a comparative evaluation of topographic maps based on "Kohonen Self Organizing Maps" (SOM). These results show that the mapping method has to be chosen very carefully and different methods should be tested for an application.
