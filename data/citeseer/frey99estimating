Estimating Mixture Models of Images and Inferring Spatial Transformations Using the EM Algorithm Presented at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Ft. Collins, CO, June, 1999. Mixture modeling and clustering algorithms are effective, simple ways to represent images using a set of data centers. However, in situations where the images include background clutter and transformations such as translation, rotation, shearing and warping, these methods extract data centers that include clutter and represent dierent transformations of essentially the same data. Taking face images as an example, it would be more useful for the dierent clusters to represent dierent poses and expressions, instead of cluttered versions of dierent translations, scales and rotations. By including clutter and transformation as unobserved, latent variables in a mixture model, we obtain a new \transformed mixture of Gaussians", which is invariant to a specied set of transformations. We show how a linear-time EM algorithm can be used to t this model by jointly estimating a mixture mo...
