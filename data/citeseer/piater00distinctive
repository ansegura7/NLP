Distinctive Features Should Be Learned Most existing machine vision systems perform recognition based on a xed set  of hand-crafted features, geometric models, or eigen-subspace decomposition.  Drawing from psychology, neuroscience and intuition, we show that certain  aspects of human performance in visual discrimination cannot be explained by  any of these techniques. We argue that many practical recognition tasks for  articial vision systems operating under uncontrolled conditions critically depend  on incremental learning. Loosely motivated by visuocortical processing,  we present feature representations and learning methods that perform biologically  plausible functions. The paper concludes with experimental results  generated by our method.  1 Introduction  How exible are the representations for visual recognition, encoded by the neurons of the human visual cortex? Are they predetermined by a xed developmental schedule, or does their development depend on their stimulation? Does their development cease at some poin...
