Distributed Knowledge Networks Distributed Knowledge Networks (DKN) provide some of the key enabling technologies for translating recent advances in automated data acquisition, digital storage, computers and communications into fundamental advances in organizational decision support, data analysis, and related applications. DKN include computational tools for accessing, organizing, transforming, and analyzing the contents of heterogeneous, distributed data and knowledge sources and for distributed problem solving and decision making under tight time, resource, and performance constraints. This paper presents an overview of the DKN project in the Iowa State University Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  I. Introduction  Advanced scientific research (e.g., the genome project), military applications (e.g., intelligence data handling, situation assessment, command and control) , law enforcement (e.g., terrorism prevention), crisis management, design and manufacturing systems, and medical information infrastructure, pow...
