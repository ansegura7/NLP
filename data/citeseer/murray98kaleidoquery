Kaleidoquery: A Visual Query Language for Object Databases In this paper we describe Kaleidoquery, a visual query language for object databases with the same expressive power as OQL. We will describe the design philosophy behind the filter flow nature of Kaleidoquery and present each of the language's constructs, giving examples and relating them to OQL. The Kaleidoquery language is described independent of any implementation details, but a brief description of a 3D interface currently under construction for Kaleidoquery is presented. The queries in this implementation of the language are translated into OQL and then passed to the object database O 2 for evaluation.  KEYWORDS: Visual query language, OQL, object databases, three-dimensional interface.  INTRODUCTION  The lack of a generally accepted and widely supported query language has probably had a significant effect in slowing the uptake of early commercial object-oriented databases. However, the emergence of the Object Query Language (OQL) which is being standardised by the Object Databas...
