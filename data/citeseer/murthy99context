Context Filters for Document-Based Information Filtering In this paper we propose a keyPhrase-sense disambiguation methodology called "context filters" for use in keyPhrase based information filtering systems. A context filter finds whether an input keyPhrase has occurred in the required context. Context filters consider various factors of ambiguity. Some of these factors are special to information filtering and they are handled in a structured fashion. The proposed context filters are very comprehensibile. Context filters consider varieties of contexts which are not considered in existing word-sense disambiguation methods but these are all needed for information filtering. The ideas on context filters that we report in this paper form important elements of an Instructible Information Filtering Agent that we are developing. 1. Introduction  Information filtering is the process of separating out irrelevant documents from relevant ones. Its importance has motivated several researchers to develop software agents such as SIFT, InfoScan, iAgent, ...
