On the Portability and Tuning of Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation Systems This report describes a set of experiments carried out to explore the portability of  alternative supervised Word Sense Disambiguation algorithms. The aim of the work  is threefold: firstly, studying the performance of these algorithms when tested on a  different corpus from that they were trained on; secondly, exploring their ability to  tune to new domains, and thirdly, demonstrating empirically that the LazyBoosting  algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art supervised WSD algorithms in both previous  situations.  Keywords: Word Sense Disambiguation, Machine Learning, Natural Language  Processing, Portability and Tuning of NLP systems.  1 Introduction  Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of assigning the appropriate meaning (sense) to a given word in a text or discourse where this meaning is distinguishable from other senses potentially attributable to that word. As an example, table 1 shows the definition of two senses of the word age  1  and an example sentence  2  for eac...
