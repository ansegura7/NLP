Task Models, Intentions, and Agent Conversation Policies . It is possible to define conversation policies, such as communication  or dialogue protocols, that are based strictly on what messages and,  respectively, what performatives may follow each other. While such an  approach has many practical applications, such protocols support only "local  coherence" in a conversation. Lengthy message exchanges require some  infrastructure to lend them "global coherence." Recognition of agent intentions  about the joint task is essential for this global coherence, but there are further  mechanisms needed to ensure that both local and global coherence are jointly  maintained. This paper presents a general yet practical approach to designing,  managing, and engineering agents that can do simple run-time intention  recognition without creating complex multi-state protocols. In this approach we  promote developing abstract task models and designing conversation policies  in terms of such models. An implemented agent assistant based on these ideas is  brie...
