Using PageRank to Characterize Web Structure Recent work on modeling the Web graph has dwelt on capturing  the degree distributions observed on the Web. Pointing out that  this represents a heavy reliance on "local" properties of the Web graph,  we study the distribution of PageRank values (used in the Google search  engine) on the Web. This distribution is of independent interest in optimizing  search indices and storage. We show that PageRank values on  the Web follow a power law. We then develop detailed models for the  Web graph that explain this observation, and moreover remain faithful  to previously studied degree distributions. We analyze these models,  and compare the analyses to both snapshots from the Web and to graphs  generated by simulations on the new models. To our knowledge this represents  the first modeling of the Web that goes beyond fitting degree  distributions on the Web.
