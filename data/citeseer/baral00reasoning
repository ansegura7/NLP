Reasoning Agents In Dynamic Domains The paper discusses an architecture for intelligent agents based on the use of A-Prolog - a language of logic programs under the answer set semantics. A-Prolog is used to represent the agent's knowledge  about the domain and to formulate the agent's reasoning tasks. We outline how these tasks can be reduced to answering questions about  properties of simple logic programs and demonstrate the methodology  of constructing these programs.  Keywords: Intelligent agents, logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoning.  1 INTRODUCTION  This paper is a report on the attempt by the authors to better understand  the design of software components of intelligent agents capable of reasoning, planning and acting in a changing environment. The class of such agents includes, but is not limited to, intelligent mobile robots, softbots, immobots, intelligent information systems, expert systems, and decision-making systems. The ability to design intelligent agents (IA) is crucial for such diverse tasks as ...
