D'Agents: Applications and Performance of a Mobile-Agent System D'Agents is a general-purpose mobile-agent system that has been used in several informationretrieval  applications. In this paper, we  rst examine one such application, operational support  for military  eld personnel, where D'Agents greatly simpli  es the task of providing ecient,  application-speci  c access to remote information resources. After describing the application, we  discuss the key dierences between D'Agents and most other mobile-agent systems, notably its  support for strong mobility and multiple agent languages. Finally, we derive a small, simple  application that is representative of many information-retrieval tasks, including those in the  example application, and use this application to compare the scalability of mobile agents and  traditional client/server approaches. The results con  rm and quantify the usefulness of mobile  code, and perhaps more importantly, con  rm that intuition about when to use mobile code is  usually correct. Although signi  cant additional experiments are needed to fully characterize the  complex mobile-agent performance space, the results here help answer the basic question of when  mobile agents should be considered at all, particularly for information-retrieval applications.
