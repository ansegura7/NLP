Multi-Agent Architectures as Organizational Structures A Multi-Agent System (MAS) is an organization of coordinated autonomous agents that interact in order to achieve particular, possible common goals. Considering real world organizations as an analogy, this paper proposes architectural styles for MAS which adopt concepts from organizational theories. The styles are modeled using the i* framework which o#ers the notions of actor, goal and actor dependency and specified in Formal Tropos. They are evaluated with respect to a set of software quality attributes, such as predictability or adaptability. In addition, we conduct a comparative study of organizational and conventional software architectures using the mobile robot control example from the Software Engineering literature. The research is conducted in the context of Tropos, a comprehensive software system development methodology.
