A Framework for Designing and Implementing the User Interface of a Geographic Digital Library . Geographic data are useful for a large set of applications, such as urban planning and environmental control. These data are, however, very expensive to acquire and maintain. Moreover, their use is often restricted due to a lack of dissemination mechanisms. Digital libraries are a good approach for increasing data availability and therefore reducing costs, since they provide e#cient storage and access to large volumes of data. One major drawback to this approach is that it creates the necessity of providing facilities for a large and heterogeneous community of users to search and interact with these geographic libraries. We present a solution to this problem, based on a framework that allows the design and construction of customizable user interfaces for applications based on Geographic Digital Libraries (GDL). This framework relies on two main concepts: a geographic user interface architecture and a geographic digital library model.  Key words: Digital libraries -- User interfaces -...
