A New Research Tool for Intrinsic Hardware Evolution . The study of intrinsic hardware evolution relies heavily on commercial FPGA devices which can be configured in real time to produce physical electronic circuits. Use of these devices presents certain drawbacks to the researcher desirous of studying fundamental principles underlying hardware evolution, since he has no control over the architecture or type of basic configurable element. Furthermore, analysis of evolved circuits is difficult as only external pins of FPGAs are accessible to test equipment. After discussing current issues arising in intrinsic hardware evolution, this paper presents a new test platform designed specifically to tackle them, together with experimental results exemplifying its use. The results include the first circuits to be evolved intrinsically at the transistor level. 1 Introduction  In recent years, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied to the design of electronic circuitry with significant results being attained using both computer simulations...
