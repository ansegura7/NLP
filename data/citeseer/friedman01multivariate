Multivariate Information Bottleneck The Information bottleneck method is an unsupervised  non-parametric data organization technique.  Given a joint distribution P (A; B), this  method constructs a new variable T that extracts  partitions, or clusters, over the values of A that  are informative about B. The information bottleneck  has already been applied to document  classification, gene expression, neural code, and  spectral analysis. In this paper, we introduce  a general principled framework for multivariate  extensions of the information bottleneck method.  This allows us to consider multiple systems of  data partitions that are inter-related. Our approach  utilizes Bayesian networks for specifying  the systems of clusters and what information  each captures. We show that this construction  provides insight about bottleneck variations  and enables us to characterize solutions of these  variations. We also present a general framework  for iterative algorithms for constructing solutions,  and apply it to several examples.
