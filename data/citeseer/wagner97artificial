Artificial Agents and Logic Programming . Artificial agents represent a new paradigm in software engineering and Artificial Intelligence. As complex software-controlled systems they are capable of flexible autonomous behavior in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Over the past few years, researchers in computer science have begun to recognise that the technology of artificial agents provides the key to solving many problems in distributed computing and intelligent control, for which traditional software engineering techniques offer no solution. The field of logic programming includes many important concepts, such as declarativity, unification, meta-logic programming, and deduction rules, from which the new technology of multiagent systems can benefit. 1 Introduction Although the idea of agent systems is intuitively appealing, and there are a number of implemented systems that claim to realize this popular idea, the basic concepts underlying these systems are often not well-understood, and no attempt is made to define t...
