Estimating Resemblance of MIDI Documents Abstract. Search engines often employ techniques for determining syntactic similarity of Web pages. Such a tool allows them to avoid returning multiple copies of essentially the same page when a user makes a query. Here we describe our experience extending these techniques to MIDI music files. The music domain requires modification to cope with problems introduced in the musical setting, such as polyphony. Our experience suggests that when used properly these techniques prove useful for determining duplicates and clustering databases in the musical setting as well. 1
