Highly Concurrent Shared Storage . Shared storage arrays enable thousands of storage devices to be shared and directly  accessed by end hosts over switched system-area networks, promising databases and filesystems highly  scalable, reliable storage. In such systems, hosts perform access tasks (read and write) and management  tasks (migration and reconstruction of data on failed devices.) Each task translates into multiple  phases of low-level device I/Os, so that concurrent host tasks can span multiple shared devices and  access overlapping ranges potentially leading to inconsistencies for redundancy codes and for data  read by end hosts. Highly scalable concurrency control and recovery protocols are required to coordinate  on-line storage management and access tasks. While expressing storage-level tasks as ACID transactions  ensures proper concurrency control and recovery, such an approach imposes high performance  overhead, results in replication of work and does not exploit the available knowledge about storage  le...
