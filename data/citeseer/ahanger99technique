Techniques For Automatic Digital Video Composition Recent developments in digital technology have enabled a class of video-based applications that were not previously viable. However, digital video production systems face the challenge of accessing the inherently linear and time-dependent media of audio and video, and providing effective means of composing them into a cohesive piece for presentation. Moreover, there are no appropriate metrics that allow for assessment of the quality of an automatically-composed video piece. Techniques presently available are limited in scope, and do not account for all the features of a composition. This dissertation presents metrics that evaluate the quality of a video composition. In addition, it proposes techniques for automatic composition of video presentations as well as improvements in access to digital video data. Yet another challenge faced by video production systems is the customization of the presentation to suit user profiles. For instance, certain elements of video compositions, such as v...
