Topic-Based Mixture Language Modelling This paper describes an approach for constructing a mixture of language models based  on simple statistical notions of semantics using probabilistic models developed for information  retrieval. The approach encapsulates corpus-derived semantic information  and is able to model varying styles of text. Using such information, the corpus texts  are clustered in an unsupervised manner and a mixture of topic-specific language models  is automatically created. The principal contribution of this work is to characterise  the document space resulting from information retrieval techniques and to demonstrate  the approach for mixture language modelling. A comparison is made between manual  and automatic clustering in order to elucidate how the global content information is  expressed in the space. We also compare (in terms of association with manual clustering  and language modelling accuracy) alternative term-weighting schemes and the  effect of singular value decomposition dimension reduction (...
