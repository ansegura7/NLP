Classification Space for Augmented Surgery, an Augmented Reality Case Study One of the recent design goals in Human Computer Interaction has been to extend the sensorymotor capabilities of computer systems to combine the real and the virtual in order to assist the user in his environment. Such systems are called Augmented Reality (AR). Although AR systems are becoming more prevalent we still do not have a clear understanding of this interaction paradigm. In this paper we propose OPAS as a generic framework for classifying existing AR systems. Computer Assisted Medical Interventions (CAMI), for which the added value of AR has been demonstrated by experience, are discussed in light of OPAS. We illustrate OPAS using our system, CASPER (Computer ASsisted PERicardial puncture), a CAMI system which assists in surgical procedures (pericardial punctures). KEYWORDS: Augmented Surgery, CAMI, Augmented Reality, Classification Space  1. INTRODUCTION  The term "Augmented Reality" (AR) appears in the literature usually in conjunction with the term "Virtual Reality" (VR). Th...
