From Active Objects to Autonomous Agents This paper studies how to extend the concept of active objects  into a structure of agents. It first discusses the requirements for autonomous  agents that are not covered by simple active objects. We  propose then the extension of the single behavior of an active object  into a set of behaviors with a meta-behavior scheduling their activities.  To make a concrete proposal based on these ideas we describe how we  extended a framework of active objects, named Actalk, into a generic  multi-agent platform, named DIMA. We discuss how this extension  has been implemented. We finally report on one application of DIMA  to simulate economic models.  Keywords: active object, agent, implementation, meta-behavior, modularity, re-usability, simulation.  1 Introduction  Object-oriented concurrent programming (OOCP) is the most appropriate and promising technology to implement agents. The concept of active object may be considered as the basic structure for building agents. Furthermore, the combinat...
