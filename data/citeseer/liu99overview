Overview of the ROL2 Deductive Object-Oriented Database System This paper presents an overview of ROL2, a novel deductive object-oriented database system developed at the University of Regina. ROL2 supports in a rule-based framework nearly all important object-oriented features such as object identity, complex objects, typing, information hiding, rule-based methods, encapsulation of such methods, overloading, late binding, polymorphism, class hierarchies, multiple structural and behavioral inheritance with overriding, blocking, and conflict handling. It is so far the only deductive system that supports all these features in a pure rule-based framework.
