Location Oriented Integration of Internet Information - Mobile Info Search - Information on the Internet is becoming more attractive and  useful for our daily life. It provides things on the town, happenings on  the city, and learning of the real world. If we can utilize such information  for the interaction between the human and the city, it can enhance the  value and the function of the city. In this paper we introduce the research  project "Mobile Info Search" in which we study the method of integrating  heterogeneous information in a location-oriented way for providing it in  a handy form with mobile computing. We have a prototype of Mobile  Info Search at http://www.kokono.net/, a location-based "search engine".  Local information such as yellow pages, maps, and relevant Web pages  at any location of Japan are provided with a simple interface. From the  analysis of test services, we will discuss the user issues and information  source issues; What kind of local information is welcomed? What can  we learn from collected documents? Through the experience of handling  various contents related to the real-world, we describe the potential of  the Internet information for the digital city efforts.  1
