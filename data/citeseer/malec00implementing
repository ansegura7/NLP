Implementing Teams of Agents Playing Simulated Robot Soccer . This article is intended to present an overview of the issues  related to implementing teams of cooperating agents playing simulated  robot soccer. First we introduce the concept of robot soccer and the  simulated environment. Then we discuss why the (simulated) robot soccer  is an interesting application area from the point of view of robotics  and articial intelligence. The main part of the paper contains a discussion  of agent architectures, both from theoretical and practical point  of view. Later we discuss how to combine individual agents into teams  having common strategies and goals. We also discuss learning, both on  individual and team levels.  1 Introduction  Robot soccer is a growing area of interest for the robotics and articial intelligence communities. There are many reasons for that. The main one is the complexity of the domain together with a set of well-dened rules governing the behaviour of the agents in this domain. The domain is suited for experiments both in ...
