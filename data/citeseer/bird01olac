The OLAC Metadata Set and Controlled Vocabularies As language data and associated  technologies proliferate and as the  language resources community rapidly  expands, it has become difficult to  locate and reuse existing resources.  Are there any lexical resources for  such-and-such a language? What  tool can work with transcripts in  this particular format? What is a  good format to use for linguistic data  of this type? Questions like these  dominate many mailing lists, since  web search engines are an unreliable  way to find language resources.  This paper describes a new digital  infrastructure for language resource  discovery, based on the Open Archives  Initiative, and called OLAC -- the  Open Language Archives Community.  The OLAC Metadata Set and the  associated controlled vocabularies  facilitate consistent description and  focussed searching. We report progress  on the metadata set and controlled  vocabularies, describing current issues  and soliciting input from the language  resources community.  1
