Case-Based and Symbolic Classification Algorithms . Contrary to symbolic learning approaches, that represent a learned concept explicitly, case-based approaches describe concepts implicitly  by a pair (CB;sim), i.e. by a measure of similarity sim and a set CB of cases. This poses the question if there are any differences concerning the learning power of the two approaches. In this article we will study the relationship between the case base, the measure of similarity, and the target concept of the learning process. To do so, we transform a simple symbolic learning algorithm (the version space algorithm) into an equivalent case-based variant. The achieved results strengthen the hypothesis of the equivalence of the learning power of symbolic and casebased methods and show the interdependency between the measure used by a case-based algorithm and the target concept. 1 Introduction  In this article we want to compare the learning power of two important learning paradigms -- the symbolic and the case-based approach [1, 4]. As a first step ...
