Visualisation Effectiveness Providing evaluations of visualisations is one way to demonstrate that they support a purpose and are adequate for the role claimed for them. The problem in doing so is that there is no central source of evaluation issues that one can use a subset of for this purpose. There is also very little in the way of agreement over what constitutes a good visualisation hence the evaluation criteria differ. There are the human-computer interaction ideals, the slightly differing ones from usability engineering, those from the visualisation community, and also the need to be able to support the variable abilities of the users. Graphics, as the medium behind visualisation, may support greater bandwidth, but is also prone to more likes and dislikes than other forms of interface. The concept of visualisation effectiveness and therefore ways of evaluating visualisations provide the focus for this paper.  Keywords: Visualisation, Evaluation, Usability,  Understanding  1
