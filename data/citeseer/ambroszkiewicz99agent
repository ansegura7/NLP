Agent Virtual Organizations within the Framework of Network Computing: a case study We study the concept of agent virtual organization and show how it relates to the paradigm of Network Based Computing [28]. We also discuss the paradigm of BDI-agent trying to show that sophisticated architecture of BDI-agent can not be efficiently applied for large worlds.

Cyberspace, in the shape of the Internet, intranets, and the World Wide Web, has grown phenomenally in recent years. Cyberspace now contains enormous amounts of information and is also being increasingly...
