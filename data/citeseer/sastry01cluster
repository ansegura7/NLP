Cluster Optimization Using Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm This study presents an ecient atomic  cluster optimization algorithm that utilizes  a hybrid extended compact genetic algorithm  along with an eciency enhancement  technique called seeding. Empirical results  indicate that the population size and total  number of function evaluations scale  up with the cluster size as O n  0:83    and  O n  2:45    respectively. The results also indicate  that the proposed algorithm is not  only very reliable in predicting lowest energy  structures, but also has a better scale  up of number of function evaluations with  the cluster size.
