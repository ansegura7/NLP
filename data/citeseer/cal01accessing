Accessing Data Integration Systems through Conceptual Schemas Data integration systems provide access to a set of heterogeneous,  autonomous data sources through a so-called global, or mediated  view. There is a general consensus that the best way to describe the global  view is through a conceptual data model, and that there are basically two  approaches for designing a data integration system. In the global-as-view  approach, one defines the concepts in the global schema as views over  the sources, whereas in the local-as-view approach, one characterizes the  sources as views over the global schema. It is well known that processing  queries in the latter approach is similar to query answering with incomplete  information, and, therefore, is a complex task. On the other hand,  it is a common opinion that query processing is much easier in the former  approach. In this paper we show the surprising result that, when the  global schema is expressed in terms of a conceptual data model, even a  very simple one, query processing becomes di#cult in the global-as-view  approach also. We demonstrate that the problem of incomplete information  arises in this case too, and we illustrate some basic techniques for  e#ectively answering queries posed to the global schema of the data integration  system.  1
