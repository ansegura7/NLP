Architecture-Centric Object-Oriented Design Method for Multi-Agent Systems This paper introduces an architecture-centric object-oriented design method for MAS  (Multi-Agent Systems) using the extended UML (Unified Modeling Language). The  UML extension is based on design principles that are derived from characteristics of  MAS and concept of software architecture which helps to design reusable and wellstructured  multi-agent architecture. The extension allows one to use original objectoriented  method without syntactic or semantic changes which implies the preservation  of OO productivity, i.e., the availability of developers and tools, the utilization of past  experiences and knowledge, and the seamless integration with other systems.  Keywords: multi-agent systems, architecture, object-oriented development methods  1. Introduction  Software agents provide a new way of analyzing, designing, and implementing complex software systems. Currently, agent technology is used in wide variety of applications with range from comparatively small systems such as
