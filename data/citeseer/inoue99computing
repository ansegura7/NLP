Computing Extended Abduction Through Transaction Programs this paper, we propose a computational mechanism for extended abduction. When a background theory is written in a normal logic program, we introduce its transaction program for computing extended abduction. A transaction program is a set of non-deterministic production rules that declaratively specify addition and deletion of abductive hypotheses. Abductive explanations are then computed by the fixpoint of a transaction program using a bottom-up model generation procedure. The correctness of the proposed procedure is shown for the class of acyclic covered abductive logic programs. In the context of deductive databases, a transaction program provides a declarative specification of database update.  Keywords: abduction, nonmonotonic reasoning, database update 1. Introduction  1.1. Motivation and background Abduction is inference to best explanations, and has recently been recognized as a very important form of reasoning in both AI [2
