Fuzzy Meta-Learning: Preliminary Results Learning from distributed data is becoming in  our times a necessity, but it is also a complex and  challenging task. Approaches developed so far  have not dealt with the uncertainty, imprecision  and vagueness involved in distributed learning.  Meta-Learning, a successful approach for distributed  data mining, is in this paper extended to  handle the imprecision and uncertainty of the local  models and the vagueness that characterizes  the meta-learning process. The proposed approach,  Fuzzy Meta-Learning uses a fuzzy inductive  algorithm to meta-learn a global model from  the degrees of certainty of the output of local  classifiers. This way more accurate models of  collective knowledge can be acquired from data  with application both to inherently distributed databases  and parts of a very large database. Preliminary  results are promising and encourage further  research towards this direction.  1
