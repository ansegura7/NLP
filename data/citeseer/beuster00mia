MIA - An Ubiquitous Multi-Agent Web Information System This paper gives a brief overview about AI methods and techniques we have developed for building ubiquitous web information systems. These methods from areas of machine learning, logic programming, knowledge representation and multi-agent systems are discussed in the context of our prototypical information system MIA. MIA is a web information system for mobile users, who are equipped with a PDA (Palm Pilot), a cellular phone and a GPS device or cellular WAP phone. It captures the main issues of ubiquitous computing: location awareness,  anytime information access and PDA technology.  1 Introduction  Nowadays, the biggest but also the most chaotic and unstructured source of information is the World-WideWeb. Making this immense amount of information available for ubiquitous computing in daily life is a great challenge. Besides hardware issues for wireless ubiquitous computing, that still are to be solved (wireless communication, blue-tooth technologies, wearable computing units, integrat...
