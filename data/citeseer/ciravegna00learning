Learning to Tag for Information Extraction from Text . LearningPINOCCHIO is an algorithm for adaptive information extraction. It learns template filling rules that insert SGML tags into texts. LearningPINOCCHIO is based on a covering algorithm that learns rules by bottom-up generalization of instances in a tagged corpus. It has been tested on three scenarios in informal domains in two languages (Italian and English). Experiments report excellent results with respect to the current state of the art. 1 Introduction By general agreement the main barriers to wide use and commercialization of IE are the difficulties in adapting systems to new applications and domains. In the last years there has been increasing interest in applying machine learning to Information Extraction from text [13, 3, 9, 1, 11]. In particular there is an increasing interest in the application of adaptive IE to Web pages [12, 10] and to informal domains (rental ads, email messages, etc.) [15, 8, 2] for building fully automated systems. This is due from one side to the...
