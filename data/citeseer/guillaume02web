The Web Graph: an Overview this paper, a study is made on a 200 millions vertices graph obtained from a crawl of the Web, and it appears that is is composed of four parts of equivalent sizes. See Figure 3. The first part is the largest strongly connected component of the graph (the second largest is much smaller), which composes the core of the well connected pages. The second part, called IN, is composed of those pages from which the core is reachable, but which are not reachable from the core. Conversly, the third part, called OUT, is the set of pages reachable from the core but from which the core is unreachable. Finally, the dendrites are the pages reachable from one of the three first parts, or from which one of the three first parts is reachable, but which belong to none of the previous parts. Only ten percent of the whole graph do not belong to one of these four parts which compose the bow-tie
