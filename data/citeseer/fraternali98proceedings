Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Deductive Databases and Logic . . . The integration of concepts from logic and deduction into databases and knowledge bases has created the field of deductive databases. Logic programming provides a powerful declarative language for accessing and maintaining knowledge in databases. Techniques from relational databases and automated deduction are useful for achieving efficient retrieval and reasoning in large knowledge bases. Thus, deductive databases can be used for building intelligent information systems.  The contributions in this Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Deductive Databases and Logic Programming DDLP'98 are grouped into four sessions: theoretical aspects, applications, Datalog extensions, and semantics and a demo session.  3  4  Contents  Preface 7 Schedule of Presentations 11 Theoretical Aspects 13 Nieves R.
