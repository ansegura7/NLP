Named Entity Recognition from Diverse Text Types Current research in Information Extraction  tends to be focused on application-specific systems  tailored to a particular domain. The Muse  system is a multi-purpose Named Entity recognition  system which aims to reduce the need for  costly and time-consuming adaptation of systems  to new applications, with its capability for  processing texts from widely di#ering domains  and genres. Although the system is still under  development, preliminary results are encouraging,  showing little degradation when processing  texts of lower quality or of unusual types. The  system currently averages 93% precision and  95% recall across a variety of text types.
