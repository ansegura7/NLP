Automated Derivation of Complex Agent Architectures from Analysis Specifications . Multiagent systems have been touted as a way to meet the need for  distributed software systems that must operate in dynamic and complex  environments. However, in order for multiagent systems to be effective, they  must be reliable and robust. Engineering multiagent systems is a non-trivial  task, providing ample opportunity for even experts to make mistakes. Formal  transformation systems can provide automated support for synthesizing  multiagent systems, which can greatly improve their correctness and reliability.  This paper describes a semi-automated transformation system that generates an  agent's internal architecture from an analysis specification in the MaSE  methodology.  1
