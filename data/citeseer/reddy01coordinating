Coordinating Heterogeneous Work: Information and Representation in Medical Care Introduction  The concept of a common information space, or CIS, has become an influential way to think about the use of shared information in collaboration. Originating in the work of Schmidt and Bannon (1992), and further explored by Bannon and Bdker (1997), it was designed to extend then-current notions about the role of technology and shared information.  At the time this was originally proposed, a great deal of technical attention was being paid to the development of "shared workspace" systems (e.g. Lu and Mantei 1991; Ishii et al. 1992). These systems attempted to extend the workspaces of conventional single-user applications such as word processors and drawing tools, allowing synchronous or asynchronous collaboration across digital networks. Designing effective shared workspace systems presented a range of technical challenges concerning appropriate network protocols, synchronisation, concurrency control mechanisms, and user interface design. Still, over time con
