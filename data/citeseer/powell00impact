The Impact of Database Selection on Distributed Searching Abstract The proliferation of online information resources increases the importance of effective and efficient distributed searching. Distributed searching is cast in three parts ??? database selection, query processing, and results merging. In this paper we examine the effect of database selection on retrieval performance. We look at retrieval performance in three different distributed retrieval testbeds and distill some general results. First we find that good database selection can result in better retrieval effectiveness than can be achieved in a centralized database. Second we find that good performance can be achieved when only a few sites are selected and that the performance generally increases as more sites are selected. Finally we find that when database selection is employed, it is not necessary to maintain collection wide information (CWI), e.g. global idf. Local information can be used to achieve superior performance. This means that distributed systems can be engineered with more autonomy and less cooperation. This work suggests that improvements in database selection can lead to broader improvements in retrieval performance, even in centralized (i.e. single database) systems. Given a centralized database and a good selection mechanism, retrieval performance can be improved by decomposing that database conceptually and employing a selection step. 1
