Model Checking Agent UML Protocol Diagrams Agents in multiagent systems use protocols in order to exchange messages and to coordinate together. Since agents and objects are not exactly the same, designers do not use directly communication protocols used in distributed systems but a new type called interaction protocols encompassing agent features such as richer messages and the ability to cooperate and to coordinate. Obviously, designers consider formal description techniques used for communication protocols. New graphical modeling languages based on UML appeared several years ago. Agent UML is certainly the best known. Until now, no validation is given for Agent UML. The aim of this paper is to present how to model check Agent UML protocol diagrams.
