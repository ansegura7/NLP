Task Assignment in Multiagent Systems based on Vickrey-type Auctioning and Leveled Commitment Contracting . A key problem addressed in the area of multiagent systems  is the automated assignment of multiple tasks to executing agents. The  automation of multiagent task assignment requires that the individual  agents (i) use a common protocol that prescribes how they have to interact  in order to come to an agreement and (ii) x their nal agreement  in a contract that species the commitments resulting from the assignment  on which they agreed. The work reported in this paper is part of a  broader research eort aiming at the design and analysis of approaches to  automated multiagent task assignment that combine auction protocols  and leveled commitment contracts. The primary advantage of such approaches  is that they are applicable in a broad range of realistic scenarios  in which knowledge-intensive negotiation among agents is not feasible  and in which unforeseeable future environmental changes may require  agents to breach their contracts. Examples of standard auction protocols  are the...
