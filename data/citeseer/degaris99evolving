Evolving an Optimal De/Convolution Function for the Neural Net Modules of ATR's Artificial Brain Project This paper reports on efforts to evolve an optimum de/convo-lution function to be used to convert analog to binary signals (spike trains) and vice versa for the binary input/output signals of the neural net circuit modules evolved at electronic speeds by the so-called "CAM-Brain Machine (CBM)" of ATR's Artificial Brain Project [1, 2, 3]. The CBM is an FPGA based piece of hardware which will be used to evolve tens of thousands of cellular automata based neural network circuits or modules at electronic speeds in about a second each, which are then downloaded into humanly architected artificial brains in a large RAM space [2, 3]. Since state-of-the-art programmable FPGAs constrained us to use 1 bit binary signaling in our neural model (the "CoDi-1Bit" model [4]), an efficient de/convolution technique is needed to convert digital signals to analog and vice versa, so that "evolutionary engineers" (EEs) who evolve the many modules, can think it terms of analog signals when they need to, rath...
