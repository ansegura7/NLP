Building An Artificial Brain Using An FPGA Based "CAM-Brain Machine" This paper reports on recent progress made in ATR's attempt to build a 10,000 evolved neural net module artificial brain to control the behaviors of a life sized robot kitten. 1. Introduction This paper presents progress in ATR's Artificial Brain (CAM-Brain) Project. The broad aim of ATR's artificial brain project, is to build/grow/evolve an artificial brain containing a billion artificial neurons by the year 2001. The basic ideas of the CAM-Brain Project are as follows. Use cellular automata (CA) as the foundation upon which to grow and evolve neural network circuits, with user defined functionality. The state of each cellular automata cell can be stored in one or two bytes of RAM. Since nowadays it is possible to have a gigabyte of RAM in one's workstation, there is a huge space in which to store the CA cell states, more than enough to contain an artificial brain. The next consideration in the CAM-Brain Project was how to evolve these neural networks quickly enough for "Brain Buildin...
