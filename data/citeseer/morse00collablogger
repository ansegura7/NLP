The software  was instrumented to log users' interactions with the system and each other. The CollabLogger addresses the problem of helping investigators analyze the volumes of log data that groupware tools can generate. Visual tools are powerful when large amounts of diverse data present  themselves. The place-based collaboration environment offered by Teamwave Workplace provided a level of organization that allowed us to create a visual interface with which to perform exploratory sequential data analysis.
