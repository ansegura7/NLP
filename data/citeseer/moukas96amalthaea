Amalthaea: Information Discovery and Filtering using a Multiagent Evolving Ecosystem Agents are semi-intelligent programs that assist the user in performing repetitive  and time-consuming tasks. Information discovery and information filtering are  a suitable domain for applying agent technology. Ideas drawn from the field of  autonomous agents and artificial life are combined in the creation of an evolving  ecosystem composed of competing and cooperating agents. A co-evolution model  of information filtering agents that adapt to the various user's interests and information  discovery agents that monitor and adapt to the various on-line information  sources is analyzed. Results from a number of experiments are presented and discussed.  Keywords: Agents, Information Filtering, Evolution, World-Wide-Web  1 Introduction  The exponential increase of computer systems that are interconnected in on-line networks has resulted in a corresponding exponential increase in the amount of information available on-line. This information is distributed among heterogeneous sources and is...
