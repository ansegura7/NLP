Towards Web-Scale Web Archeology Web-scale Web research is difficult. Information on the Web is vast in quantity, unorganized and uncatalogued, and available only over a network with varying reliability. Thus, Web data is difficult to collect, to store, and to manipulate efficiently. Despite these difficulties, we believe performing Web research at Web-scale is important. We have built a suite of tools that allow us to experiment on collections that are an order of magnitude or more larger than are typically cited in the literature. Two key components of our current tool suite are a fast, extensible Web crawler and a highly tuned, in-memory database of connectivity information. A Web page repository that supports easy access to and storage for billions of documents would allow us to study larger data sets and to study how the Web evolves over time.
