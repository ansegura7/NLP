A Formal Specification of dMARS   The Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) is the best established agent  architecture currently available. It has been deployed in many major industrial  applications, ranging from fault diagnosis on the space shuttle to air traffic management  and business process control. The theory of PRS-like systems has also  been widely studied: within the intelligent agents research community, the beliefdesire  -intention (BDI) model of practical reasoning that underpins PRS is arguably  the dominant force in the theoretical foundations of rational agency. Despite  the interest in PRS and BDI agents, no complete attempt has yet been made  to precisely specify the behaviour of real PRS systems. This has led to the development  of a range of systems that claim to conform to the PRS model, but which  differ from it in many important respects. Our aim in this paper is to rectify this  omission. We provide an abstract formal model of an idealised dMARS system  (the most recent implementation of the PRS...
