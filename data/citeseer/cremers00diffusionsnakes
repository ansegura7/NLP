Diffusion-snakes using statistical shape knowledge  We present a novel extension of the Mumford-Shah functional  that allows to incorporate statistical shape knowledge at the computational  level of image segmentation. Our approach exhibits various favorable  properties: non-local convergence, robustness against noise, and  the ability to take into consideration both shape evidence in given image  data and knowledge about learned shapes. In particular, the latter property  distinguishes our approach from previous work on contour-evolution  based image segmentation. Experimental results conrm these properties.
