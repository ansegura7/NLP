Learning Situation-Specific Coordination in Cooperative Multi-agent Systems Achieving effective cooperation in a multi-agent system is a difficult problem for a number of reasons such as limited and possiblyout-dated views of activities of other agents and uncertainty about the outcomes of interacting non-local tasks. In this paper, we present a learning system called COLLAGE, that endows the agents with the capability to learn how to choose the most appropriate coordination strategy from a set of available coordination strategies. COLLAGE relies on meta-level information about agents' problem solving situationsto guide them towards a suitable choice for a coordination strategy. We present empirical results that strongly indicate the effectiveness of the learning algorithm. Keywords: Multi-agent Systems, Coordination, Learning  1 Introduction  Coordination is the process of effectively managing interdependencies between activities distributed across agents so as to derive maximum benefit from them[21, 6]. Based on structure and uncertainty in their environmen...
