A Collective Robotics Application Based On Emergence And Self-Organization This paper presents a collective robotics application, which consists of making a pool of robots regroup objects that are distributed in their environment. The innovative aspect in our approach rests on a system integrating operationally autonomous robots that make the global task achieved by virtue of emergence and self-organization. 1 INTRODUCTION Our work fits in the framework of Bottom-Up Artificial Intelligence (Bottom-Up AI in short) and more particularly in that of Autonomous Agents. We are concerned with collective phenomena and their issues and more precisely the way to carry out solutions that allow a multi-robot system to achieve global tasks by virtue of emergence and self-organization. Our work is supported by two types of experiments, namely those involving multi-agent simulations and those involving real robots. Our paper precisely presents a collective robotics application, which consists of making a pool of autonomous robots regroup objects that are distributed in thei...
