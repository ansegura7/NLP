Web Interaction and the Navigation Problem in Hypertext written for Encyclopedia of Microcomputers The web has become a ubiquitous tool, used in day-to-day work, to find information  and conduct business, and it is revolutionising the role and availability of information. One  of the problems encountered in web interaction, which is still unsolved, is the navigation  problem, whereby users can "get lost in hyperspace", meaning that when following a  sequence of links, i.e. a trail of information, users tend to become disoriented in terms of  the goal of their original query and the relevance to the query of the information they are  currently browsing.  Herein we build statistical foundations for tackling the navigation problem based on a  formal model of the web in terms of a probabilistic automaton, which can also be viewed  as a finite ergodic Markov chain. In our model of the web the probabilities attached  to state transitions have two interpretations, namely, they can denote the proportion of  times a user followed a link, and alternatively they can denote the expected utility of  following a link. Using this approach we have developed two techniques for constructing a  web view based on the two interpretations of the probabilities of links, where a web view  is a collection of relevant trails. The first method we describe is concerned with finding  frequent user behaviour patterns. A collection of trails is taken as input and an ergodic  Markov chain is produced as output with the probabilities of transitions corresponding  to the frequency the user traversed the associated links. The second method we describe  is a reinforcement learning algorithm that attaches higher probabilities to links whose  expected trail relevance is higher. The user's home page and a query are taken as input  and an ergodic Markov chain is produced as output with the probabilities of...
