Web Usage Mining - Languages and Algorithms We propose two new XML applications, XGMML and LOGML. XGMML is a graph description language and LOGML is a web-log report description language. We generate a web graph in XGMML format for a web site using the web robot of the WWWPal system (developed for web visualization and organization). We generate web-log reports in LOGML format for a web site from web log files and the web graph. In this paper, we further illustrate the usefulness of these two XML applications with a web data mining example. Moreover, we show the simplicity with which this mining algorithm can be specified and implemented efficiently using our two XML applications. We provide sample results, namely frequent patterns of users in a web site, with our web data mining algorithm.
