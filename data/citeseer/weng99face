Face Recognition Identifying a human individual from his or her face is one of the most nonintrusive modalities in biometrics. However, it is also one of the most challenging ones. This chapter discusses why it is challenging and the factors that a practitioner can take advantage of in developing a practical face recognition system. Some major existing approaches are discussed along with some algorithmic considerations. A face recognition algorithm is presented as an example along with some experimental data. Some possible future research directions are outlined at the end of the chapter.  1.1 INTRODUCTION  Face recognition from images is a sub-area of the general object recognition problem. It is of particular interest in a wide variety of applications. Applications in law enforcement for mugshot identification, verification for personal identification such as driver's licenses and credit cards, gateways to limited access areas, surveillance of crowd behavior are all potential applications of a succes...
