Bisimulation Congruences in Safe Ambients We study a variant of Levi and Sangiorgi's Safe Ambients (SA) enriched with passwords (SAP). In SAP by managing passwords, for example generating new ones and distributing them selectively, an ambient may now program who may migrate into its computation space, and when. Moreover in SAP an ambient may provide different services depending on the passwords exhibited by its incoming clients. We give an lts based operational semantics for SAP and a labelled bisimulation based equivalence which is proved to coincide with barbed congruence. Our notion of bisimulation is used to prove a set of algebraic laws which are subsequently exploited to prove more significant examples. 1
