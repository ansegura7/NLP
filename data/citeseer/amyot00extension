On the Extension of UML with Use Case Maps Concepts . Descriptions of reactive systems focus heavily on behavioral aspects,  often in terms of scenarios. To cope with the increasing complexity of services  provided by these systems, behavioral aspects need to be handled early in the  design process with flexible and concise notations as well as expressive concepts.  UML offers different notations and concepts that can help describe such  services. However, several necessary concepts appear to be absent from UML,  but present in the Use Case Map (UCM) scenario notation. In particular, Use  Case Maps allow scenarios to be mapped to different architectures composed of  various component types. The notation supports structured and incremental development  of complex scenarios at a high level of abstraction, as well as their  integration. UCMs specify variations of run-time behavior and scenario structures  through sub-maps "pluggable" into placeholders called stubs. This paper  presents how UCM concepts could be used to extend the semantics...
