Managing the Operator Ordering Problem in Parallel Databases This paper focuses on parallel query optimization. We consider the operator problem and introduce a new class of execution strategies called Linear-Oriented Bushy Trees (LBT). Compared to the related approach of the General Bushy Trees (GBT) a significant complexity reduction of the operator ordering problem can be derived theoretically and demonstrated experimentally (e.g. compared with GBTs, LBTs authorize optimization time improvement that can reach up-to 49%) without loosing quality. Finally we demonstrate that existing commercial parallel query optimizers need little extension modifications in order to handle LBTs.  Key words: Parallel databases, parallel query optimization, linear-oriented bushy  trees, extending existing optimizers.  1 Introduction  Modern database applications, such as data mining and decision support pose several new challenges to query optimization and processing [1]. One of the main issues concerns the processing of complex queries (e.g. recent Teradata rela...
