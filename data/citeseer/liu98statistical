A Statistical Method for Estimating the Usefulness of Text Databases Searching desired data in the Internet is one of the most common ways the Internet is used. No single  search engine is capable of searching all data in the Internet. The approach that provides an interface for  invoking multiple search engines for each user query has the potential to satisfy more users. When the  number of search engines under the interface is large, invoking all search engines for each query is often  not cost effective because it creates unnecessary network traffic by sending the query to a large number  of useless search engines and searching these useless search engines wastes local resources. The problem  can be overcome if the usefulness of every search engine with respect to each query can be predicted. In  this paper, we present a statistical method to estimate the usefulness of a search engine for any given  query. For a given query, the usefulness of a search engine in this paper is defined to be a combination of  the number of documents in the search engine that are sufficiently similar to the query and the average  similarity of these documents. Experimental results indicate that our estimation method is much more  accurate than existing methods.
