Design Principles For Resource Management Systems For Intelligent Spaces The idea of ubiquitous computing and smart environments is no longer a dream and has long become a serious area of research and soon this technology will start entering our every day lives. There are two major obstacles that prevent this technology from spreading. First, di#erent smart spaces are equipped with very di#erent kinds of devices (e.g. a projector vs. a computer monitor, vs. a TV set). Second, multiple applications running in a space at the same time inevitably contend for those devices and other scarce resources. The underlying software in a smart space needs to provide tools for self-adaptivity in that it shields the rest of the software from the physical constraints of the space, and that it dynamically adjusts the allocation of scarce resources as the number and priorities of active tasks change.
