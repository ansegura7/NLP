Administering Permissions for Distributed Data: Factoring and Automated Inference We extend SQL's grant/revoke model to handle all administration of permissions in a distributed database. The key idea is to "factor" permissions into simpler decisions that can be administered separately, and for which we can devise sound inference rules. The model enables us to simplify administration via separation of concerns (between technical DBAs and domain experts), and to justify fully automated inference for some permission factors. We show how this approach would coexist with current practices based on SQL permissions. Keywords: Access permissions, derived data, view, federation, warehouse 1
