A First-Order Approach to Unsupervised Learning . This paper deals with learning first-order logic rules from data lacking an explicit classification predicate. Consequently, the learned rules are not restricted to predicate definitions as in supervised Inductive Logic Programming. First-order logic offers the ability to deal with structured, multi-relational knowledge. Possible applications include first-order knowledge discovery, induction of integrity constraints in databases, multiple predicate learning, and learning mixed theories of predicate definitions and integrity constraints. One of the contributions of our work is a heuristic measure of confirmation, trading off satisfaction and novelty of the rule. The approach has been implemented in the Tertius system. The system performs an optimal best-first search, finding the k most confirmed hypotheses. It can be tuned to many different domains by setting its parameters, and it can deal either with individual-based representations as in propositional learning or with general logi...
