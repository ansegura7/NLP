DataBlitz Storage Manager: Main-Memory Database Performance for Critical Applications Introduction  General-purpose commercial disk-based database systems, though widely employed in practice, have failed to meet the performance requirements of applications requiring short, predictable response times, and extremely high throughput rates. Main memory is the only technology capable of these characteristics.  DataBlitz  1  is a main-memory storage manager product that supports the development of high-performance and fault-resilient applications requiring concurrent access to shared data. In DataBlitz, core algorithms for concurrency, recovery, index management and space management are optimized for the case that data is memory resident.  2 DataBlitz Architecture and Features  In this section, we give a high-level overview of the architecture and features of the DataBlitz Storage Manager product implemented at Bell Laboratories (for more details, see [1]).  Direct Access to Data. DataBlitz is designed to a
