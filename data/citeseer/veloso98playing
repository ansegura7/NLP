Playing Soccer with Legged Robots Sony has provided a remarkable platform for research and development in robotic agents, namely fully autonomous legged robots. In this paper, we describe our work using Sony's legged robots to participate at the RoboCup'98 legged robot demonstration and competition. Robotic soccer represents a very challenging environment for research into systems with multiple robots that need to achieve concrete objectives, particularly in the presence of an adversary. Furthermore RoboCup'98 offers an excellent opportunity for robot entertainment. We introduce the RoboCup context and briefly present Sony's legged robot. We developed a vision-based navigation and a Bayesian localization algorithm. Team strategy is achieved through pre-defined behaviors and learning by instruction. 1 Introduction  Problem solving in complex domains necessarily involves multiple agents, dynamic environments, and the need for learning from feedback and previous experience. Robotic soccer is an example of one such complex...
