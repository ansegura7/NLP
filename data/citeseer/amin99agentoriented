Agent-Oriented Programming in Linear Logic This thesis investigates how a linear logic programming language, such as Lygon, can be  used in the implementation of agent-oriented programs. Agent-oriented programming is a recent  computational framework of interest to both academic and industrial researchers. Agent  methodology is being successfully utilised in designing complex (distributed) applications  that require concurrency, reasoning, communication, sharing and integration of knowledge,  and, of course, intelligence. On the other hand, linear logic, a logic of resource-consumption,  provides the possibility to construct efficient tools for modelling updates, reasoning about the  environment and implementing concurrency. Linear logic has been used as a basis for creating  a number of programming languages. One of these is the logic programming language  Lygon. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the possibility of implementing agents with  Lygon. A number of experiments have been carried out and results analysed, which...
