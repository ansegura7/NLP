Focused Crawls, Tunneling, and Digital Libraries Crawling the Web to build collections of documents related  to pre-specified topics became an active area of research during the late  1990's after crawler technology was developed for the benefit of search  engines. Now, Web crawling is being seriously considered as an important  strategy for building large scale digital libraries. This paper considers  some of the crawl technologies that might be exploited for collection  building. For example, to make such collection-building crawls more effective,  focused crawling was developed, in which the goal was to make  a "best-first" crawl of the Web. We are using powerful crawler software  to implement a focused crawl but use tunneling to overcome some of the  limitations of a pure best-first approach. Tunneling has been described  by others as not only prioritizing links from pages according to the page's  relevance score, but also estimating the value of each link and prioritizing  on that as well. We add to this mix by devising a tunneling focused  crawling strategy which evaluates the current crawl direction on the fly to  determine when to terminate a tunneling activity. Results indicate that  a combination of focused crawling and tunneling could be an e#ective  tool for building digital libraries.
