Reality Browsing: Using Information Interaction and Robotic Autonomy for Planetary Exploration . Reality browsing is a framework that enables distributed control of a team of planetary robots. In it, prioritized  user queries are serviced in a hierarchical data structure consisting of an Internet-accessible world model, data archives  on the remote robots and finally a multiple-robot planner that coordinates query-directed searches. This paper introduces  the reality browser concept and outlines important research issues required for implementation.
