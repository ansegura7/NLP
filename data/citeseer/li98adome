ADOME: An Advanced Object Modelling Environment ADOME, ADvanced Object Modeling Environment, an approach to integrating data and knowledge management based on object-oriented technology, is presented. Next generation information systems will require more flexible data modelling capabilities than those provided by current object-oriented DBMSs. In particular, integration of data and knowledge management capabilities will become increasingly important. In this context, ADOME provides versatile role facilities that serve as "dynamic binders" between data objects and production rules, thereby facilitating flexible data and knowledge management integration. A prototype that implements this mechanism and the associated operators has been constructed on top of a commercial object-oriented DBMS and a rule base system.  Index Terms: Object modeling, knowledge semantics, dynamic roles, object-oriented databases, nextgeneration information systems 1 Introduction  Increasingly, organizations require more intelligent information management. In o...
