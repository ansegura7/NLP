A Methodology to Retrieve Text Documents from Multiple Databases In this paper, we present a methodology for finding the n most similar documents across multiple text  databases for any given query and for any positive integer n. This methodology consists of two steps.  First, the contents of databases are indicated approximately by database representatives. Databases  are ranked using their representatives in a certain order with respect to the given query. We provide  a necessary and sufficient condition to rank the databases optimally. In order to satisfy this necessary  and sufficient condition, we provide three estimation methods. One estimation method is intended for  short queries; the other two are for all queries. Second, we provide an algorithm, OptDocRetrv, to  retrieve documents from the databases according to their rank and in a particular way. We show that  if the databases containing the n most similar documents for a given query are ranked ahead of other  databases, our methodology will guarantee the retrieval of the n most similar d...
