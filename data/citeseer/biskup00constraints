Constraints in Object-Oriented Databases Normal forms in relational database theory, like 3NF or BCNF, are dened by  means of semantic contraints. Since for these constraints sound and complete axiomatisations  exist and, additionally, for some of these constraints the implication  problem is decidable, computer aided database design is possible for relational  data models. Object-oriented database theory lacks such normal forms, partly  because neither a classication of semantic constraints nor sound and complete  axiomatisations exist.  In this work we present three classes of semantic constraints for object-oriented  data models and show that these constraints have a sound and complete axiomatisation.  Thus we prepare the grounds for normal forms in object-oriented data  models and subsequently for computer aided object-oriented database design.  1 Introduction  The theory of database design for relational data models identies a number of properties to characterise good database schemas. These properties lead then to no...
