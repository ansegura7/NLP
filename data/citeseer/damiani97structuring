Structuring and Querying the Web through Graph-Oriented Languages . In order to pose effective queries to Web sites, some form of site data model must be implicitly or explicitly shared by users. Many approaches try to compensate for the lack of such a common model by considering the hypertextual structure of Web sites; unfortunately, this structure has usually little to do with data semantics. In this paper a different technique is proposed that allows for both navigational and data model description of Web sites, while allowing for graphical queries. The data model is based on WGlog, a description and query language based on the graph-oriented object database model of GOOD [Gys94] and G-log [Par95] allowing description of data manipulation primitives via graph transformations. WG-log description of the navigational part of a Web site schema is lexically based on standard hypermedia design languages, thus allowing for easy schema generation by current hypermedia authoring environments. The use of WG-log for queries allows graphic query construction ...
