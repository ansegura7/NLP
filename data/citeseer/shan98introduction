Introduction to the Relationlog System Advanced applications require construction, efficient access and management of large databases with rich data structures and inference mechanisms. However, such capabilities are not directly supported by the existing database systems. In this paper, we describe Relationlog, a persistent deductive database system that is able to directly support the storage, efficient access and inference of data with complex structures. 1 Introduction  Advanced applications require construction, efficient access and management of large databases with rich data structures and inference mechanisms. However, such capabilities are not directly supported by the existing database systems. Deductive databases have the potential to meet the demands of advanced applications. They grew out of the integration of logic programming and relational database technologies. They are intended to combine the best of the two approaches, such as representational and operational uniformity, inference capabilities, recursion,...
