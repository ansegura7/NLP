Distributed and Disappearing User Interfaces in . . . f expression, will often dominate the pure functional aspect to a user. We are already witnessing this transition with mobile phones.  Novel computational artifacts based on these technologies may become `invisible', or reside in the background, in several different ways:  Truly invisible - when the actual computer and its interface is almost totally integrated with an environment that is familiar to the user. The user interaction model is implicit and perhaps even unnoticeable to the user. Such a system truly resides in the background of the user's attention at all times.  Transparent - here the `invisible' UI is not invisible in the literal sense. Rather, it is transparent in the same sense as a very familiar tool is transparent to its user, to the point where it almost acts as an extension of one's body.
