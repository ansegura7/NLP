Weight Adjustment Schemes for a Centroid Based Classifier In recent years we have seen a tremendous growth in the volume of text documents available on the Internet, digital  libraries, news sources, and company-wide intra-nets. Automatic text categorization, which is the task of assigning  text documents to pre-specified classes (topics or themes) of documents, is an important task that can help both in  organizing as well as in finding information on these huge resources. Similarity based categorization algorithms such  as k-nearest neighbor, generalized instance set and centroid based classification have been shown to be very effective  in document categorization. A major drawback of these algorithms is that they use all features when computing the  similarities. In many document data sets, only a small number of the total vocabulary may be useful for categorizing  documents. A possible approach to overcome this problem is to learn weights for different features (or words in  document data sets). In this report we present two fast iterativ...
