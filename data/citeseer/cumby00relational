Relational Representations that Facilitate Learning Given a collection of objects in the world,  along with some relations that hold among  them, a fundamental problem is how to learn  denitions of some relations and concepts of  interest in terms of the given relations. These  denitions might be quite complex and, inevitably,  might require the use of quanti-  ed expressions. Attempts to use rst order  languages for these purposes are hampered  by the fact that relational inference is  intractable and, consequently, so is the problem  of learning relational denitions.  This work develops an expressive relational  representation language that allows the use  of propositional learning algorithms when  learning relational denitions.  The representation serves as an intermediate  level between a raw description of observations  in the world and a propositional learning  system that attempts to learn denitions  for concepts and relations. It allows for hierarchical  composition of relational expressions  that can be evaluated ecientl...
