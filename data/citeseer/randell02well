The Well Mannered Wearable Computer In this paper we describe continuing work being carried out as part of the Bristol Wearable Computing Initiative. We are interested in the use of context sensors to improve the usefulness of wearable computers. A CyberJacket incorporating a Tourist Guide application has been built, and we have experimented with location and movement sensing devices to improve its performance. In particular, we have researched processing techniques for data from accelerometers which enable the wearable computer to determine the user's activity.
