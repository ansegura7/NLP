Proactive Detection of Distributed Denial of Service Attacks using MIB Traffic Variables - A Feasibility Study In this paper we propose a methodology for utilizing Network Management Systems for the early detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks. Although there are quite a large number of events that are prior to an attack (e.g. suspicious logons, start of processes, addition of new files, sudden shifts in traffic, etc.), in this work we depend solely on information from MIB (Management Information Base) Traffic Variables collected from the systems participating in the Attack. Three types of DDoS attacks were effected on a Research Test Bed, and MIB variables were recorded. Using these datasets, we show how there are indeed MIB-based precursors of DDoS attacks This work was supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory (Rome, NY - USA) under contract F30602-00-C-0126 to Scientific Systems Company, and by Aprisma's University Fellowship Program 1999/2000. 1 that render it possible to detect them before the Target is shut down. Most importantly, we describe how the relevant MI...
