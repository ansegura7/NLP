Data Warehouse Scenarios for Model Management Model management is a framework for supporting meta-data related  applications where models and mappings are manipulated as first class objects  using operations such as Match, Merge, ApplyFunction, and Compose. To demonstrate  the approach, we show how to use model management in two scenarios  related to loading data warehouses. The case study illustrates the value of model  management as a methodology for approaching meta-data related problems. It  also helps clarify the required semantics of key operations. These detailed  scenarios provide evidence that generic model management is useful and, very  likely, implementable.
