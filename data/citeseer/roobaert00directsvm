DirectSVM: A Fast And Simple Support Vector Machine Perceptron .  We propose a simple implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for pattern recognition, that is not based on solving a complex quadratic optimization problem. Instead we propose a simple, iterative algorithm that is based on a few simple heuristics. The proposed algorithm nds high-quality solutions in a fast and intuitively-simple way. In experiments on the COIL database, on the extended COIL database and on the Sonar database of the UCI Irvine repository, DirectSVM is able to nd solutions that are similar to these found by the original SVM. However DirectSVM is able to nd these solutions substantially faster, while requiring less computational resources than the original SVM.  INTRODUCTION  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) belong to the best-performing learning algorithms available. They have produced remarkable performance in a number of dicult learning tasks without requiring prior knowledge. We mention amongst others the following examples in pattern recognition: handwr...
