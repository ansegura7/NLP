Modeling And Simulation Of Mobile Agents Agent-oriented software implies the realization of software components, which are mobile, autonomous, and solve problems by creating new software components during run-time, moving between locations, initiating or joining groups of other software components. Modeling and simulating those multiagent systems requires specific mechanisms for variable structure modeling.  JAMES, a Java-Based Agent Modeling Environment for Simulation, realizes variable structure models including mobility from the perspective of single autonomous agents. JAMES itself is based on parallel DEVS and adopts its abstract simulator model. Simulation takes place as a sending of messages between concurrently active and locally distributed entities which reflect the model's current structure. Thus, modeling and simulation are coined equally by an agent-based perspective.  1 Introduction  The definition of agents subsumes a multitude of different facets [30]. Agents are reactive, deliberative or combine reactive with ...
