A Sequence-Based Object-Oriented Model for Video Databases Structuration, annotation and composition, are amidst the most crucial modeling issues that video editing and querying in the context of a database entail. In this paper, we propose a sequence-based, object-oriented data model that addresses them in an unified, yet orthogonal way. This orthogonality allows to capture the interactions between these three aspects, i.e. annotations may be attached to any level of video structuration, and the composition operators preserve the structurations and annotations of the argument videos. The proposed model reuses concepts stemming from temporal databases, so that operators defined in this latter setting may be used to query it. Accordingly, the query language for video databases proposed in this paper, is a variant of a temporal extension of ODMG's OQL. The main components of the proposal have been formalized and implemented on top of an object-oriented DBMS.  Keywords: video databases, sequence databases, object-oriented databases, ODMG.
