(LP)2, an Adaptive Algorithm for Information Extraction from Web-related Texts (LP)  2  is an algorithm for adaptive Information  Extraction from Web-related text that induces  symbolic rules by learning from a corpus tagged  with SGML tags. Induction is performed by  bottom-up generalisation of examples in a  training corpus. Training is performed in two  steps: initially a set of tagging rules is learned;  then additional rules are induced to correct  mistakes and imprecision in tagging. Shallow  NLP is used to generalise rules beyond the flat  word structure. Generalization allows a better  coverage on unseen texts, as it limits data  sparseness and overfitting in the training phase.  In experiments on publicly available corpora the  algorithm outperforms any other algorithm  presented in literature and tested on the same  corpora. Experiments also show a significant  gain in using NLP in terms of (1) effectiveness  (2) reduction of training time and (3) training  corpus size. In this paper we present the  machine learning algorithm for rule induction.  In particular we focus on the NLP-based  generalisation and the strategy for pruning both  the search space and the final rule set.  1.
