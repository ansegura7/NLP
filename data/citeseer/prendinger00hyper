The Hyper System: Knowledge Reformation for Efficient First-order Hypothetical Reasoning . We present the Hyper system that implements a new approach  to knowledge compilation, where function-free first-order acyclic  Horn theories are transformed to propositional logic. The compilation  method integrates techniques from deductive databases (relevance reasoning)  and theory transformation via unfold/fold transformations, to  obtain a compact propositional representation. The transformed theory  is more compact than the ground version of the original theory in terms  of significantly less and mostly shorter clauses. This form of compilation,  called knowledge (base) reformation, is important since the most efficient  reasoning methods are defined for propositional theories, while knowledge  is most naturally expressed in a first-order language. In particular,  we will show that knowledge reformation allows low-order polynomial  time inference to find a near-optimal solution in cost-based first-order  hypothetical reasoning (or `abduction') problems. We will also present  ex...
