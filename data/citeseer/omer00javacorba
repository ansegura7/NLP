A Java/CORBA based Visual Program Composition Environment for PSEs A Problem Solving Environment (PSE) is a complete, integrated computing environment for composing, compiling and running applications in a specific problem area or domain. Parts of the PSE are domain independent, such as the Visual Programming Composition Environment (VPCE), which may be used for constructing application in a number of different domains, however, other parts are domain specific, such as rules to support particular types of components. A domain independent VPCE is first described, which serves as a user interface for a PSE, and uses Java and CORBA to provide a framework of tools to enable the construction of scientific applications from components. The VPCE consists of a component repository, from which the user can select off-the-shelf or in-house components, a graphical composition area on which components can be combined, various tools that facilitate the configuration of components, the integration of legacy codes into components and the design and bui...
