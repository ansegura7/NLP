TxnWrap: A Transactional Approach to Data Warehouse Maintenance A Data Warehouse Management System (DWMS) maintains materialized views derived from one or more information sources (ISs) under source changes. Much recent research has developed maintenance algorithms to achieve data warehouse consistency under source data updates typically by sending additional compensation-based messages to information source space. Given the highly dynamic nature of modern distributed environments such as the WWW, both source data or schema changes are likely to occur autonomously and even concurrently. Most previous solutions become invalid under this new requirement, causing both wrong query results returned from IS space or even complete rejection messages. This paper now proposes to tackle this problem from a different angle by rephasing it as a global distributed transaction problem, and develops a novel solution strategy that is not only handling this as of now unsolved problem of concurrent source shcmea changes but also added benefit is more efficient than previous solutions from the literature. As foundation of our solution, we encapsulate the complete data warehouse maintenance process as a DWMS Transaction. We design a multiversion timestamp source wrapper materialization and associated concurrency control algorithm that guarantees a consistent view of the information source space data inside each DWMS Transaction, thus removing the maintenance anomaly problem. This integrated solution called TxnWrap is proven to be correct and achieve complete consistency of data warehouse maintenance even under a mixture of concurrent data updates or schema changes. TxnWrap is complementary to previous maintenance algorithms of removing their concurrency considerations. We have implemented TxnWrap and plugged it into an existing DWMS testbed...
