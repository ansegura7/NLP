Parameter Control Using the Agent Based Patchwork Model The setting of parameters in Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) has crucial influence on their performance. Typically, the best choice depends on the optimization task. Some parameters yield better results when they are varied during the run. Recently, the so-called TerrainBased Genetic Algorithm (TBGA) was introduced, which is a self-tuning version of the traditional Cellular Genetic Algorithm (CGA). In a TBGA, the individuals of the population are placed in a two-dimensional grid, where only neighbored individuals can mate with each other. The position of an individual in this grid is interpreted as its offspring 's specific mutation rate and number of crossover points. This approach allows to apply GA parameters that are optimal for (i) the type of optimization task and (ii) the current state of the optimization process. However, only a few individuals can apply the optimal parameters simultaneously due to their fixed position in the grid lattice. In this paper, we substituted the fixed s...
