A Web-based Intelligent Tutoring System Using Hybrid Rules as its Representational Basis In this paper, we present the architecture and describe the functionality of a Web-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), which uses neurules for knowledge representation. Neurules are a type of hybrid rules integrating symbolic rules with neurocomputing. The use of neurules as the knowledge representation basis of the ITS results in a number of advantages.
