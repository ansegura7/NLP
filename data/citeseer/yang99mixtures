Mixtures of Linear Subspaces for Face Detection We present two methods using mixtures of linear subspaces for face detection in gray level images. One method uses a mixture of factor analyzers to concurrently perform clustering and, within each cluster, perform local dimensionality reduction. The parameters of the mixture model are estimated using an EM algorithm. A face is detected if the probability of an input sample is above a predened threshold. The other mixture of subspaces method uses Kohonen 's self-organizing map for clustering and Fisher Linear Discriminant to nd an optimal projection and a Gaussian distribution to model the class-conditional density function of the projected samples for each class. The parameters of the class-conditional density functions are maximum likelihood estimates and the decision rule is also based on maximum likelihood. A wide range of face images including ones in dierent poses, with dierent expressions and under dierent lighting conditions are used as the training set to capture the varia...
