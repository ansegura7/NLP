The CLEF 2003 Interactive Track The CLEF 2003 Interactive Track (iCLEF) was the third  year of a shared experiment design to compare strategies for cross-language  search assistance. Two kinds of experiments were performed: a) experiments  in Cross-Language Document Selection, where the user task is to  scan a ranked list of documents written in a foreign language, selecting  those which seem relevant to a given query. The aim here is to compare  di#erent translation strategies for an "indicative" purpose; and b)  Full Cross-Language Search experiments, where the user task is to maximize  the number of relevant documents that can be found in a foreignlanguage  collection with the help of an end-to-end cross-language search  system. Participating teams could choose to focus on any aspects of the  search task (e.g., query formulation, query translation and/or relevance  feedback). This paper describes the shared experiment design and briefly  summarizes the experiments run by the five teams that participated.
