PMS: a PVC Management System for ATM Networks . Reported in this paper is the developed PMS, a PVC management  system for ATM networks. PMS provides a scalable, end-to-end path  management solution required for managing todays complex ATM networks.  It aims to assist the network operators to perform PVC operations with  simplified procedures and automatic optimum route selection. It also aims to  provide effective decision-making support for PVC fault identification and  prevention to the network operators.  1 Introduction  ATM communication network is playing more and more important role in todays  telecommunication networks. It has been widely used in backbone networks, transmission networks, access networks, and even enterprise networks. Such emerging large heterogeneous ATM networks have raised many new challenges for researchers and developers in the area of network management. In the management of ATM communication networks that have increased dramatically in size and complexity, the PVC (Permanent Virtual Circuit) managemen...
