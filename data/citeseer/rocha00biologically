Biologically Motivated Distributed Design for Adaptive Knowledge Management We discuss how distributed designs that draw from biological network metaphors can largely improve the current state of information retrieval and knowledge management of distributed information systems. In particular, two adaptive recommendation systems named TalkMine and @ApWeb are discussed in more detail. TalkMine operates at the semantic level of keywords. It leads different databases to learn new and adapt existing keywords to the categories recognized by its communities of users using distributed algorithms.
