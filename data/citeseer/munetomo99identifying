Identifying Linkage Groups by Nonlinearity/Non-monotonicity Detection This paper presents and discusses direct  linkage identification procedures based  on nonlinearity/non-monotonicity detection.  The algorithm we propose checks arbitrary  nonlinearity/non-monotonicity of fitness  change by perturbations in a pair of  loci to detect their linkage. We first discuss  condition of the linkage identification by  nonlinearity check (LINC) procedure (Munetomo  & Goldberg, 1998) and its allowable  nonlinearity. Then we propose another condition  of the linkage identification by nonmonotonicity  detection (LIMD) and prove its  equality to the LINC with allowable nonlinearity  (LINC-AN). The procedures can identify  linkage groups for problems with at most  order-k difficulty by checking O(2  k  ) strings  and the computational cost for each string is  O(l  2  ) where l is the string length.  1 Introduction  The definition of linkage in genetics is `the tendency for alleles of different genes to be passed together from one generation to the next' (Winter, Hickey...
