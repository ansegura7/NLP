Prediction with Local Patterns using Cross-Entropy Sets of local patterns in the forms of rules and co-occurrence counts are produced by many data mining methods such as association rule algorithms. While such patterns can yield useful insights it is not obvious how to synthesize local sparse information into a coherent global predictive model. We study the use of a cross-entropy approach to combining local patterns. Each local pattern is viewed as a constraint on an appropriate high-order joint distribution of interest. Typically, a set of patterns returned by a data mining algorithm under-constrains the high-order model. The cross-entropy criterion is used to select a specific distribution in this constrained family relative to a prior. We review the iterative-scaling algorithm which is an iterative technique for finding a joint distribution given constraints. We then illustrate the application of this method to two specific problems. The first problem is combining information about frequent itemsets. We show that the cross-entropy a...
