A Comparative Study of Neural Network Based Feature Extraction Paradigms The projection maps and derived classification accuracies of a neural network (NN) implementation of Sammon's mapping, an auto-associative NN (AANN) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) feature extractor are compared with those of the conventional principal component analysis (PCA). Tested on five real-world databases, the MLP provides the highest classification accuracy at the cost of deforming the data structure, whereas the linear models preserve the structure but usually with inferior accuracy.
