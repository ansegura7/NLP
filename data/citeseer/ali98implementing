Implementing Schema-theoretic Models of Animal Behavior in Robotic Systems Formal models of animal sensorimotor behavior can provide effective methods for generating robotic intelligence. In this paper we describe how schema-theoretic models of the praying mantis are implemented on a hexapod robot equipped with a real-time color vision system. The model upon which the implementation is based was developed by ethologists studying mantids. This implementation incorporates a wide range of behaviors, including obstacle avoidance, prey acquisition, predator avoidance, mating, and chantlitaxia behaviors. 1 Introduction  Ecological robotics refers to incorporating aspects of the relationship a robot maintains with its environment into its control system (i.e., its ecology) [4]. One means for developing such a control system is by exploiting models of behavior developed by ethologists or neuroscientists. Although considerable research has been conducted in the modeling of neural controllers based on animal models (e.g., [3, 5, 14]), incorporation of environmental int...
