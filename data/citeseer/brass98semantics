Semantics Of (disjunctive) Logic Programs Based On Partial Evaluation SEMANTICS AND TRANSFORMATIONS  In this paper, we consider allowed disjunctive DATALOG  :  programs over some fixed function-free finite signature \Sigma. In fact, in the semantical part of this paper, we consider only the ground instantiation of the programs, because we claim that any sensible semantics should assign the same meaning to a program P and its instantiation ground(P ). So the variables are seen only as a shorthand for denoting ground programs in a more compact way. This means that in the semantical part, we could as well have worked with propositional programs. However, in the computational part, it would be very inefficient to compute first the ground instantiation of the given program. Here we make use of the allowedness condition: every variable of the rule must occur also in a positive body literal. This guarantees that in every rule application, all variables are bound to a constant. It is  5 true that in this way we again manage to consider only ground programs. But...
