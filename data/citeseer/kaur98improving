Improving Interaction with Virtual Environments Introduction  Virtual environments (VEs) provide a computer-based interface to a real-life or abstract space, using 3D graphics and 3D interaction techniques. VEs represent a novel interface style which offers new possibilities and challenges to human-computer interface design. However, studies of the design of VEs (Kaur et al., 1996) show that designers lack a coherent approach to design, especially interaction design. Designers appear to be pre-occupied with difficult technical issues and think little about supporting user interaction. However, major interaction problems have been found with current VEs, such as disorientation, perceptual misjudgements and difficulty finding and understanding available interactions (McGovern, 1993; COVEN, 1997). These common problems have been known to result in user frustration and a low usability and acceptability for the VE (Kaur et al., 1996; Miller 1994). Guidance is needed on interaction design for VEs to avoid such usability problems.
