Resolution-Based Proof for Multi-Modal Temporal Logics of Knowledge Temporal logics of knowledge are useful in order to specify complex systems in which agents are both dynamic and have information about their surroundings. We present a resolution method for propositional temporal logic combined with multi-modal S5 and illustrate its use on examples. This paper corrects a previous proposal for resolution in multi-modal temporal logics of knowledge.  Keywords: temporal and modal logics, non-classical  resolution, theorem-proving  1 Introduction  Combinations of logics have been useful for specifying and reasoning about complex situations, for example multi-agent systems [21, 24], accident analysis [15], and security protocols [18]. For example, logics to formalise multi-agent systems often incorporate a dynamic component representing change of over time; an informational component to capture the agent's knowledge or beliefs; and a motivational component for notions such as goals, wishes, desires or intentions. Often temporal or dynamic logic is used for...
