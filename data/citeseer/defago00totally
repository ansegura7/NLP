Totally Ordered Broadcast and Multicast Algorithms: A Comprehensive Survey Total order multicast algorithms constitute an important class of problems in distributed systems, especially  in the context of fault-tolerance. In short, the problem of total order multicast consists in sending  messages to a set of processes, in such a way that all messages are delivered by all correct destinations in the  same order. However, the huge amount of literature on the subject and the plethora of solutions proposed so  far make it difficult for practitioners to select a solution adapted to their specific problem. As a result, naive  solutions are often used while better solutions are ignored.  This paper proposes a classification of total order multicast algorithms based on the ordering mechanism  of the algorithms, and describes a set of common characteristics (e.g., assumptions, properties) with which  to evaluate them. In this classification, more than fifty total order broadcast and multicast algorithms are surveyed.  The presentation includes asynchronous algorithms ...
