Mining Soft-Matching Rules from Textual Data Text mining concerns the discovery of knowledge  from unstructured textual data. One important task  is the discovery of rules that relate specific words  and phrases. Although existing methods for this  task learn traditional logical rules, soft-matching  methods that utilize word-frequency information  generally work better for textual data. This paper  presents a rule induction system, TEXTRISE, that  allows for partial matching of text-valued features  by combining rule-based and instance-based learning.  We present initial experiments applying TEX-  TRISE to corpora of book descriptions and patent  documents retrieved from the web and compare  its results to those of traditional rule and instance  based methods.  1 Introduction  Text mining, discovering knowledge from unstructured natural-language text, is an important data mining problem attracting increasing attention [Hearst, 1999; Feldman, 1999; Mladenic, 2000] . Existing methods for mining rules from text use a hard, logical ...
