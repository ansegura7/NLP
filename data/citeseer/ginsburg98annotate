Annotate - A Web-based Knowledge Management Support System for Document Collections Difficulties with web-based full text information retrieval (IR) systems include spurious matches, manually intensive document sifting, and the absence of communication or coordination between users. Furthermore, it is not clear how to best design a Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) system which possesses coordination mechanisms in the inherently stateless Web environment. Document collections in an Intranet are a particularly interesting problem; electronic documents contain the potential for improving information throughput and knowledge transfer in organizations. The emergence of Intranet infrastructure creates new IR demands as all users can easily publish documents online. The associated problems include inefficient discovery and proliferation of documents regardless of quality, which in turn implies the mismanagement of the authors' expertise. This thesis investigates how to design an IR system to support KM in organizations. I propose an architecture and implement a n...
