Panel: Is Generic Metadata Management Feasible? dels,   such as invert and compose?   ## What is the role of an expression language that captures the semantics of models and mappings, not only   for design but also for run-time execution?   ## Does a generic approach offer any advantages for   model manipulation areas of current interest, such as   data integration and XML?   If the skeptics are right that a generic approach to model   management is unachievable pie-in-the-sky, are writers of   metadata-driven applications doomed forever to writing   special-purpose object-at-a-time code for navigating their   information structures? If so, what is the leverage that the   database field can offer for these problems?   2. Panelists   ## Dr. Laura Haas, IBM Research is working on a tool   that can (semi-)automatically produce mappings   between two data representations. She has been   working on various aspects of data integration since   starting the Garlic project in 1994.   ##<
