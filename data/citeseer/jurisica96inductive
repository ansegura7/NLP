Inductive Learning and Case-Based Reasoning This paper describes an application of an inductive learning techniques to case-based reasoning. We introduce two main forms of induction, define case-based reasoning and present a combination of both. The evaluation of the proposed system, called TA3, is carried out on a classification task, namely character recognition. We show how inductive knowledge improves knowledge representation and in turn flexibility of the system, its performance (in terms of classification accuracy) and its scalability.  1. Introduction  Inductive learning is a process of generalizing specific facts or observations [MCM86]. It is a basic strategy by which one can acquire knowledge. There are two main forms associated with inductive learning: 1. Instance-to-class induction, where the learning system is presented with independent instances, representing class and the task is to induce a general description of the class. 2. Clustering problem arises when several objects or situations are presented to a learner...
