Amplifying Reality . Many novel applications take on the task of moving the personal  computer away from the desktop with the approach to merge digital  information with physical space and objects. These new applications have given  rise to a plethora of notions and terms used to classify them. We introduce  amplified reality as a concept complementary to that of augmented reality. To  amplify reality is to enhance the publicly available properties of persons and  physical objects, by means of using wearable or embedded computational  resources. The differences between the two concepts are discussed and  examples of implementations are given. The reason for introducing this term is  to contribute to the terminology available to discuss already existing  applications, but also to open up for a discussion of interesting design  implications.  Keywords: amplified reality, augmented reality, ubiquitous computing,  wearable computing, embedded vs. superimposed properties, private vs. public  1 Breaking away f...
