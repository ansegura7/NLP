Privacy Preserving Distributed Data Mining em, there is a simple distributed solution that provides a degree of privacy to the individual sites. An example association rule could be:  Received F lu shot and age > 50 implies hospital admission, where at least 5% of  insured meet all the criteria (support), and at least 30% of those meeting the flu shot  and age criteria actually require hospitalization (confidence).  There are algorithms to e#ciently find all association rules with a minimum level of support. We can easily extend this to the distributed case using the following lemma: If a rule has support > k% valid  The Data  Approach  Figure 1: Data Warehouse approach to Distributed Data Mining  globally, it must have support > k% on at least one of the individual sites.    A distributed algorithm for this would work as follows: Request that each site send all rules with support at least k. For e
