Systems Management In Concurrent Engineering Using Intelligent Software Agents Intelligent software agents are used in frameworks where large number of experts need to interact in a project concurrently as in the projects taken up by the aerospace industry. We describe one such framework and discuss an intelligent software agent to manage the systems design in such an environment. What makes the problem interesting is the existence of other intelligent agents in the framework that are responsible for various other tasks as well as other human users. Our Systems Design Management Agent (SDMA) uses its own domain knowledge to interact with the other agents and recommend strategies and policies. We take one example task of systems design management, risk management, and discuss how it is performed by the SDMA in detail. 1 Introduction Using intelligent software agents within the concurrent engineering paradigm has received attention from several research groups. The idea is to respond to the increased information and coordination demands of concurrent engineering p...
