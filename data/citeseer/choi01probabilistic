A Probabilistic Approach to Planning Biped Locomotion with Prescribed Motions Typical high-level directives for locomotion of human-like characters are encountered  frequently in animation scripts or interactive systems. In this paper, we  present a new scheme for planning natural-looking locomotion of a biped figure to  facilitate rapid motion prototyping and task-level motion generation. Given start  and goal positions in a virtual environment, our scheme gives a sequence of motions  to move from the start to the goal using a set of live-captured motion clips.
