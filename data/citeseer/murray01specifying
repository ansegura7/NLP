Specifying Agents with UML in Robotic Soccer The use of agents and multiagent systems is widespread in computer  science nowadays. Thus the need for methods to specify agents in a clear  and simple manner arises.  In this paper we propose an approach to specifying agents with the  help of UML statecharts. Agents are specified on different levels of abstraction.  In addition a method for specifying multiagent plans with explicit  cooperation is shown.  As an example domain we chose robotic soccer, which lays the basis  of the annual RoboCup competitions. Robotic soccer is an ideal testbed  for research in the fields of robotics and multiagent systems. In the  RoboCup Simulation League the research focus is laid on agents and  multiagent systems, and we will demonstrate our approach by using examples  from this domain.
