Incorporating Quality Metrics in Centralized/Distributed Information Retrieval on the World Wide Web Most information retrieval systems on the Internet rely primarily on similarity ranking algorithms based solely on term frequency statistics. Information quality is usually ignored. This leads to the problem that documents are retrieved without regard to their quality. We present an approach that combines similarity-based similarity ranking with quality ranking in centralized and distributed search environments. Six quality metrics, including the currency, availability, information-to-noise ratio, authority, popularity, and cohesiveness, were investigated. Search effectiveness was significantly improved when the currency, availability, information-to-noise ratio and page cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in centralized search. The improvement seen when the availability, information-to-noise ratio, popularity, and cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in site selection was also significant. Finally, incorporating the popularity metric in information fusion resulted in a significan...
