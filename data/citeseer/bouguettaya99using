Using Java and CORBA for Implementing Internet Databases We describe an architecture called WebFINDIT that allows dynamic couplings of Web accessible databases based on their content and interest. We propose an implementation using WWW, Java, JDBC, and CORBA's ORBs that communicate via the CORBA's IIOP protocol. The combination of these technologies offers a compelling middleware infrastructure to implement wide-area enterprise applications. In addition to a discussion of WebFINDIT's core concepts and implementation architecture, we also discuss an experience of using WebFINDIT in a healthcare application.  1 Introduction  The growth of the Internet and the Web increased dramatically the need for data sharing. The Web has brought a wave of new users and service providers to the Internet. It contains a huge quantity of heterogeneous information and services (e.g., home pages, online digital libraries, product catalogs, and so on) (Bouguettaya et al. 1998).
