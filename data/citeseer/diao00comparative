A Comparative Study of Classification Based Personal E-mail Filtering . This paper addresses personal E-mail filtering by casting it in the  framework of text classification. Modeled as semi-structured documents, Email  messages consist of a set of fields with predefined semantics and a number  of variable length free-text fields. While most work on classification either  concentrates on structured data or free text, the work in this paper deals with  both of them. To perform classification, a naive Bayesian classifier was  designed and implemented, and a decision tree based classifier was  implemented. The design considerations and implementation issues are  discussed. Using a relatively large amount of real personal E-mail data, a  comprehensive comparative study was conducted using the two classifiers. The  importance of different features is reported. Results of other issues related to  building an effective personal E-mail classifier are presented and discussed. It is  shown that both classifiers can perform filtering with reasonable accuracy.  While the decision tree based classifier outperforms the Bayesian classifier  when features and training size are selected optimally for both, a carefully  designed naive Bayesian classifier is more robust.  1
