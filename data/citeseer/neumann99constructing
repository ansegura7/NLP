Constructing A Realistic Head Animation Mesh for a Specific Person This paper addresses the problem of constructing an realistic and complete animation mesh that portrays a specific person's head geometry and texture. Our approach deforms a prototype mesh containing vector-based delineated muscles to fit one or more geometric models obtained from stereo image pairs of a specific person's head. The resulting personalized mesh facilitates animation with the same realism and predictability as the original prototype mesh. The model construction requires some manual interaction, however automatic refinement methods reduce the need for precision. The sensing process is passive and no physical markers are needed on the person's face. Models produced by our method are suited to realistic animations of specific individuals for applications in special effects, games, and 3D teleconferencing.  1. Introduction  Ever since the pioneering work of Frederic I. Parke [1] in 1972, researchers have attempted to generate realistic facial models and animation. Recent inte...
