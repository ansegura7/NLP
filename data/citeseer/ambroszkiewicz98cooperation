Cooperation Mechanisms in a Multi-Agent Distributed Environment In the paper we present our work on design and analysis of agent cooperation in distributed systems. The work is not completed yet, so that some parts of it, especially the formal framework, should be viewed as a preliminary version. Multi-agent systems are represented by BDI-automata, i.e., asynchronous automata composed of non-deterministic agents equipped with mental attitudes like belief, desire, and intentions. These attitudes are acquired by the agents by executing so called mental actions. Behaviours of multi-agent systems are represented by prime event structures. The prime event structure when augmented with utility functions defined on the terminal nodes of the structure may be viewed as games in extensive form defined on local states rather than on global states as in the classical definition. The definition of knowledge, in our framework, captures the change of state due to action executions. A notion of local knowledge-based protocols is defined. A game theory method of backwards induction is applied in order to obtain a very natural definition of rationality in agent's behaviours. All the notions are exemplified using the running example. For this example we construct several cooperation mechanisms for the agents. A team formation mechanism is one of them.
