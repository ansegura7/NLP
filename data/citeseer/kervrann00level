Level Lines as Global Minimizers of Energy Functionals in Image Segmentation We propose a variational framework for determining global  minimizers of rough energy functionals used in image segmentation. Segmentation  is achieved by minimizing an energy model, which is comprised  of two parts: the first part is the interaction between the observed  data and the model, the second is a regularity term. The optimal boundaries  are the set of curves that globally minimize the energy functional.
