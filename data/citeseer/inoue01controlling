Controlling Speculative Computation in Multi-Agent Environments In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system which performs speculative computation under incomplete communication environments. In a master-slave style multi-agent system with speculative computation, a master agent asks queries to slave agents in problem solving, and proceeds computation with default answers when answers from slave agents are delayed. We rst provide a semantics for speculative computation using default logic. Then, in the proposed system, we use the consequence- nding procedure SOL written in the Java language to perform data-driven deductive reasoning. The use of a consequence- nding procedure is convenient for updating agents' beliefs according to situation changes in the world. In our system, slave agents can change their answers frequently, yet a master agent can avoid duplicate computation. As long as actual answers from slave agents do not con- ict with any previously encountered situation, the obtained conclusions are never recomputed. We applied the proposed system to the meeting-room reservation problem to see the usefulness of the framework. 1
