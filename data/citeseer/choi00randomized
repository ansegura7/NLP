A Randomized Approach to Planning Biped Locomotion with Prescribed Motions In this paper, we present a new scheme for planning a natural-looking locomotion of a human-like biped figure. Given start and goal positions in a virtual environment, our scheme finds a sequence of motions to move from the start position to the goal using a set of prescribed, live-captured motion clips. Our scheme consists of three parts: roadmap construction, roadmap search, and motion generation. We randomly sample a set of valid configurations of the biped figure for the environment to construct a directed graph, called a roadmap, that guides the locomotion of the figure. Every edge of the roadmap is attached with a live-captured motion clip. Traversing the roadmap, we obtain the sequence of footprints and that of motion clips. We finally adapt the motion sequence to the constraints specified by the footprint sequence to obtain the locomotion.
