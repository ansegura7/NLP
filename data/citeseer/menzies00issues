Issues with Meta-Knowledge This article approaches these questions from our di#erent viewpoints  a  :  The Constructors: Motta and Kalfoglou focus on the construction of knowledge base systems (KBS) using two special kinds of meta-knowledge: ontologies [14,33] and problem solving methods (PSMs) [26,6]. PSMs model the useful inference patterns seen in previous applications. Such patterns, it is argued, simplify and clarify future implementations. Ontologies model common domain terminology. This terminology might include the data structures required by a PSM. Using a good ontology, it is argued, can guide developers in the construction of new systems. For more information on ontologies, see http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/daidb/people/homes/yannisk/seke99panelhtml.html.  The Maintainers: Altho# and Menzies focus on the maintenance and modification of KBS using case-based reasoning (CBR) [3,1] and continual testing [10,22]. CBR researchers argue that people
