SIDE Surfer: a Spontaneous Information Discovery and Exchange System Development of wireless communications enables the rise of networking applications in embedded systems. Web interactions, which are the most spread, are nowadays available on wireless PDAs. Moreover, we can observe a development of ubiquitous computing. Based on this concept, many works aim to consider user's context as part of the parameters of the applications. The context notion can include the user's location, his social activity . . . Taking part from emerging technologies enabling short range and direct wireless communications (which allow to define a proximity context), the aim of our study is to design a new kind of application, extending the Web paradigm: spontaneous and proximate Web interactions.
