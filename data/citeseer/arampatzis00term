Term Selection for Filtering based on Distribution of Terms over Time In this article we investigate the use of time distributions in retrieval tasks. Specifically, we introduce a novel term selection method, namely Term Occurrence Uniformity (TOU), based on the hypothesis that terms which occur uniformly in time are more valuable than others. Our empirical evaluation so far has neither proved nor disproved this hypothesis. However, results are promising and suggest the need for a deeper theoretical and empirical investigation. Our current concern is filtering, but this line of research may easily be extended to other retrieval tasks which involve temporally-dependent data.  1 Introduction  Information Filtering is the process of searching in large amounts of data for information which matches a user information need. The filtering task is usually described as the inverse of the traditional retrieval task. In retrieval, a one-time user request (called query) is matched to a static collection of information objects. In filtering, users issue a long-term r...
