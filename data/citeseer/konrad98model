Model Generation without Normal Forms and Applications in Natural-Language Semantics . I present a new tableaux-based model generation method for first-order formulas without function symbols. Unlike comparable approaches, the Relational Models (RM) tableaux calculus does not require clausal input theories. I propose some applications of the RM calculus in natural-language semantics and discuss its usefulness as an inference procedure in natural-language processing. 1 Introduction  Refutational methods in automated deduction prove the unsatisfiability of logical theories. For many applications, the interpretations of a theory that show its satisfiability are at least as interesting as proofs. Model generation refers to the automatic construction of such interpretations from first-order theories. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in the automated deduction community in developing model generation methods for various application areas such as finite mathematics [25, 22], deductive databases [7], diagnosis [13, 1], and planning [19]. As a result, mode...
