Using LDAP Directory Caches this paper, we consider the problem of reusing cached LDAP directory entries for answering (declarative) LDAP queries. We develop a suite of query transformations that capture the semantics of LDAP queries, and design a sound and complete algorithm for determining whether a conjunctive LDAP query is cacheanswerable  using positive query templates. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm for real applications with a preliminary performance evaluation, based on sample queries from a directory enabled application at AT&T Labs. Cache-answerability is related to the problem of finding complete rewritings of a query using views (see, e.g., [8]). A key conceptual difference arises due to the fact that we do not seek a rewriting of the original query in terms of the (views in the) semantic cache description, but want to evaluate the original query against the cached directory instance. Further, the differences of the LDAP data model and query language make the previous results inapplicable; for details, see Section 2.
