A System For Automatic Personalized Tracking of Scientific Literature on the Web We introduce a system as part of the CiteSeer digital library project for automatic tracking of scientific literature that is relevant to a user???s research interests. Unlike previous systems that use simple keyword matching, CiteSeer is able to track and recommend topically relevant papers even when keyword based query profiles fail. This is made possible through the use of a heterogenous profile to represent user interests. These profiles include several representations, including content based relatedness measures. The CiteSeer tracking system is well integrated into the search and browsing facilities of CiteSeer, and provides the user with great flexibility in tuning a profile to better match his or her interests. The software for this system is available, and a sample database is online as a public service.
