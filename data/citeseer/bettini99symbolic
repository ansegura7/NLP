Symbolic Representation of User-defined Time Granularities In the recent literature on time representation, an effort has been made to characterize the notion of time granularity and the relationships between granularities, in order to have a common framework for their specification, and to allow the interoperability of systems adopting different time granularities. This paper considers the mathematical characterization of finite and periodical time granularities, and it identifies a user-friendly symbolic formalism which captures exactly that class of granularities. This is achieved by a formal analysis of the expressiveness of well-known symbolic representation formalisms. 1. Introduction There is a wide agreement in the AI and database community on the requirement for a data/knowledge representation system of supporting standard as well as user-defined time granularities. Examples of standard time granularities are days, weeks, months, while user defined granularities may include businessweeks, trading-days, working-shifts, school-terms, wi...
