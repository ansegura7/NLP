On Current Technology for Information Filtering and User Profiling in Agent-Based Systems, Part I: A Perspective Several current techniques and methods in information filtering and  profiling are surveyed, including state-of-the art technology, various  techniques currently used by large businesses, and the academic stateof  -the-art projects. Given the simplicity of the techniques currently  applied in the field, the further development and application of technology  currently available in AI and algorithmics will yield significant  improvements in both filtering and profiling results.  1 Introduction  The terms "Information Filtering" and "profiling" are widely used. Here "Information Filtering" will refer to computer software systems which  ffl split (usually large) data streams into useful and not useful components and direct the useful to interested users. Of particular interest are systems which recognize their users are different and split the data stream into separate (possible overlapping) streams which are directed at distinct users or groups of users. Typically data in the streams is c...
