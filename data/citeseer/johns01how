How Emotions and Personality Effect the Utility of Alternative Decisions: A Terrorist Target Selection Case Study The role of emotion modeling in the development of computerized agents has long been unclear. This is  partially due to instability in the philosophical issues of the problem as psychologists struggle to build models for their  own purposes, and partially due to the often-wide gap between these theories and that which can be implemented by an  agent author. This paper describes an effort to use emotion models in part as a deep model of utility for use in decision  theoretic agents. This allows for the creation of simulated forces capable of balancing a great deal of competing goals,  and in doing so they behave, for better or for worse, in a more realistic manner.
