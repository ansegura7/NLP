Logic Programming & Multi-Agent Systems: a Synergic Combination for Applications and Semantics The paper presents an ongoing research project that uses Logic Programming, Linear Logic Programming, and their related techniques for executable specifications and rapid prototyping of Multi-Agent Systems. The MAS paradigm is an extremely rich one and we believe that Logic Programming will play a very effective role in this area, both as a tool for developing real applications and as a semantically well founded language for basing program analysis and proof of properties on.
