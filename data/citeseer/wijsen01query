On Query Optimization in a Temporal SPC Algebra Tuples of a temporal relation are equipped with a valid time period. A simple extension of the SPC (SelectionProjection  -Cross product) algebra for temporal relations is defined, which conforms to primitives in existing temporal  query languages. In particular, temporal projection involves coalescing of time intervals, which results in  non-monotonic queries. Also the "select-from-where" normal form is no longer available in this temporal extension.
