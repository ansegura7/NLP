Theoretical Investigations And Experimental Explorations Of The Necessity Of User Guidance In Case-Based Knowledge Acquisition The intention of the present paper is to justify both theoretically and experimentally that user guidance is inevitable in case-based knowledge acquisition. The methodology of our approach is quite simple: We choose a well-understood area which is tailored to case-based knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, we choose a prototypical case-based learning algorithm which is obviously suitable for the problem domain under consideration. Then, we perform a number of knowledge acquisition experiments. They clearly exhibit essential limitations of knowledge acquisition from randomly chosen cases. As a consequence, we develop scenarios of user guidance. Based on these theoretical concepts, we prove a few theoretical results characterizing the power of our approach. Next, we perform a new series of more constrained results which support our theoretical investigations. The present report aims at presenting a large amount of experimental data exceeding the space available in conference proceedings, ...
