An Overview of Active Information Gathering in InfoSleuth InfoSleuth is a system of collaborating software agents that can be configured to perform many different information management activities in a distributed environment. InfoSleuth agents advertise semantic constraints about themselves to InfoSleuth brokers using a global domain ontology. When queried, a broker reasons over these constraints to determine the minimal set of agents that can provide a solution to the query. InfoSleuth's architecture is based on a generic agent shell that provides basic agent communication behaviors over a subset of Knowledge Query Manipulation Language. Individual agents are subclasses of this generic shell that provide specific kinds of functionality. InfoSleuth agents perform a number of complex query activities that require resolving ontology-based queries over dynamically changing, distributed, heterogeneous resources, including distributed query, location-independent single-resource updates, event monitoring by means of subscription/notification servi...
