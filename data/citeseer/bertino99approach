An Approach to Classify Semi-Structured Objects . Several advanced applications, such as those dealing with the Web, need to handle data whose structure is not known a-priori. Such requirement severely limits the applicability of traditional database techniques, that are based on the fact that the structure of data (e.g. the database schema) is known before data are entered into the database. Moreover, in traditional database systems, whenever a data item (e.g. a tuple, an object, and so on) is entered, the application species the collection (e.g. relation, class, and so on) the data item belongs to. Collections are the basis for handling queries and indexing and therefore a proper classication of data items in collections is crucial. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of an extended object-oriented data model. We propose an approach to classify objects, created without specifying the class they belong to, in the most appropriate class of the schema, that is, the class closest to the object state. In particular, w...
