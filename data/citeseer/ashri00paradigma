Paradigma: Agent Implementation through Jini One of the key problems of recent years has been the divide between theoretical work in agent-based systems and its practical complement which have, to a large extent, developed along different paths. The Paradigma implementation framework has been designed with the aim of narrowing this gap. It relies on an extensive formal agent framework implemented using recent advances in Java technology. Specifically, Paradigma uses Jini connectivity technology to enable the creation of on-line communities in support of the development of agent-based systems.  1 Introduction  In a networked environment that is highly interconnected, interdependent and heterogeneous, we are faced with an explosion of information and available services that are increasingly hard to manage. Agent-based systems can provide solutions to these problems as a consequence of their dynamics of social interaction; communication and cooperation can be used to effectively model problem domains through the interaction of agent...
