ERIM's Approach to Fine-Grained Agents Traditional software agents, an extension of Artificial Intelligence,  seek human-level intelligence in each agent. For over 15 years, inspired by Artificial  Life, ERIM has been devising architectures in which useful intelligence  emerges at the system level from interactions of fine-grained agents. We have  applied such architectures to a wide variety of domains, including business, industrial,  and military. This white paper outlines three major principles that  characterize our approach. For each we discuss what the principle is, why it is  important, and how it works in practical implementations.
