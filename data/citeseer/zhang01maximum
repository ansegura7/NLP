Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Filtering Thresholds Information filtering systems based on statistical retrieval models usually compute a numeric score indicating how well each document matches each profile. Documents with scores above profile-specific dissemination thresholds are delivered.  An optimal dissemination threshold is one that maximizes a given utility function based on the distributions of the scores of relevant and non-relevant documents. The parameters of the distribution can be estimated using relevance information, but relevance information obtained while filtering is biased. This paper presents a new method of adjusting dissemination thresholds that explicitly models and compensates for this bias. The new algorithm, which is based on the Maximum Likelihood principle, jointly estimates the parameters of the density distributions for relevant and nonrelevant documents and the ratio of the relevant document in the corpus. Experiments with TREC-8 and TREC-9 Filtering Track data demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.  Keywords  Information Filtering, Dissemination Threshold, Maximum Likelihood Estimation.  1.
