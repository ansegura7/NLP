Integrating Light-Weight Workflow Management Systems within Existing Business Environments Workflow management systems support the efficient, largely au-  tomated execution of business processes. However, using a workflow management system typically requires implementing the  application's control flow exclusively by the workflow management  system. This approach is powerful if the control flow is specified and implemented from scratch, but it has severe drawbacks if a workflow management system is to be integrated within environments  with existing solutions for implementing control flow. Usual-  ly, the existing solutions are too complex to be substituted by the workflow management system at once. Hence, the workflow management system must support an incremental integration, i.e. the reuse of existing implementations of control flow as well as their in-  cremental substitution. Extending the workflow management system's functionality ac-  cording to future application needs, e.g. by worklist and history management, must also be possible. In particular, at the beginning  of...
