Time Split Linear Quadtree For Indexing Image Databases The Time Split B-Tree (TSBT) is modified for indexing a database of evolving binary images. This is accomplished by embedding ideas from Linear region Quadtrees that make the TSBT able to support spatio-temporal query processing. To improve query performance, additional pointers are added to the leaf-nodes of the TSBT. The resulting access method is called Time Split Linear Quadtree (TSLQ). Algorithms for processing five spatio-temporal queries have been adapted to the new structure. Such queries appear in Multimedia Systems, or Geographical Information Systems (GIS), when searched by content. The TSLQ was implemented and results of extensive experiments on query time performance are presented, indicating that the proposed algorithmic approaches outbalance respective straightforward algorithms. The region data sets used in the experiments were real images of meteorological satellite views and synthetic raster images.
