Probabilistic Roadmap Methods are Embarrassingly Parallel In this paper we report on our experience parallelizing probabilistic roadmap motion planning methods (prms). We show that significant, scalable speedups can be obtained with relatively little effort on the part of the developer. Our experience is not limited to prms, however. In particular, we outline general techniques for parallelizing types of computations commonly performed in motion planning algorithms, and identify potential difficulties that might be faced in other efforts to parallelize sequential motion planning methods. 1 Introduction  Automatic motion planning has application in many areas such as robotics, virtual reality systems, and computer-aided design. Although many different motion planning methods have been proposed, most are not used in practice since they are computationally infeasible except for some restricted cases, e.g., when the robot has very few degrees of freedom (dof) [12, 16]. Indeed, there is strong evidence that any complete planner (one that is guaran...
