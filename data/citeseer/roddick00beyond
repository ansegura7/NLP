Beyond Schema Versioning: A Flexible Model for Spatio-Temporal Schema Selection Schema versioning provides a mechanism for handling change in the structure of database systems and has been investigated widely, both in the context of static and temporal databases. With the growing interest in spatial and spatio-temporal data as well as the mechanisms for holding such data, the spatial context within which data items are formatted also becomes an issue. This paper presents a generalised model that accommodates temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal schema versioning within databases.
