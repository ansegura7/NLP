An Object-Oriented Case-Based Learning System This thesis first gives an overview of the subfield of classification in the area of machine learning. The numerous variants of Case-Based Learning algorithms are compared according to what kind of data is processed, how knowledge and hypotheses are represented, and what kind of reasoning or learning is performed. The strengths and weaknesses of these learning methods are compared to each other and to other groups of learning methods. A modular object-oriented LISP environment, VIE-CBR2 is introduced, that implements a number of algorithms for Case-Based Learning. This system allows to easily combine preprogrammed learning algorithms. and provides a framework for simple integration of new learning algorithms and other components that make use of the basic system.
