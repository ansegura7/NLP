Defining and Combining Symmetric and Asymmetric Similarity Measures . In this paper, we present a framework for the definition of similarity measures using lattice-valued functions. We show their strengths (particularly for combining similarity measures). Then we investigate a particular instantiation of the framework, in which sets are used both to represent objects and to denote degrees of similarity. The paper concludes by suggesting some generalisations of the findings. 1 Introduction  There are many different ways of computing the similarity of object representations. These include:  -- the feature-based approach, in which objects are represented by sets of features, and similarity is based on feature commonality and difference (e.g. [13]);  -- the geometric approach, in which objects are represented by points in an n-  dimensional space (usually specified by sets of pairs of attributes and atomic values), and similarity is based on the inverse of the distance between objects in the space (e.g. [12]); and  -- the structural approach, which uses gr...
