Transductive Inference for Text Classification using Support Vector Machines This paper introduces Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVMs) for text classification.  While regular Support Vector Machines  (SVMs) try to induce a general decision  function for a learning task, Transductive  Support Vector Machines take into account  a particular test set and try to minimize  misclassifications of just those particular  examples. The paper presents an analysis  of why TSVMs are well suited for text  classification. These theoretical findings are  supported by experiments on three test collections.  The experiments show substantial  improvements over inductive methods, especially  for small training sets, cutting the number  of labeled training examples down to a  twentieth on some tasks. This work also proposes  an algorithm for training TSVMs efficiently,  handling 10,000 examples and more.
