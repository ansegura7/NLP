Dynamic Agents this paper, we shall explain how dynamic behaviors are obtained and utilized through automatic action installation, and inter-agent communication. We also describe intra-agent communication between the carrier-part and the action part of a dynamic agent, and between di#erent actions carried by the same dynamic agent. We shall also discuss three triggering mechanisms for dynamic behavior modi#cation: planning-based, request-driven, and event-based.
