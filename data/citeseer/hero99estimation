Estimation of R??nyi Information Divergence via Pruned Minimal Spanning Trees In this paper we develop robust estimators of the R enyi information divergence (I-divergence) given a reference distribution and a random sample from an unknown distribution. Estimation is performed by constructing a minimal spanning tree (MST) passing through the random sample points and applying a change of measure which flattens the reference distribution. In a mixture model where the reference distribution is contaminated by an unknown noise distribution one can use these results to reject noise samples by implementing a greedy algorithm for pruning the k-  longest branches of the MST, resulting in a tree called the k-MST. We illustrate this procedure in the context of density discrimination and robust clustering for a planar mixture model. 1. Introduction Let Xn = fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; xn g denote a sample of i.i.d. data points in R  d  having unknown Lebesgue multivariate density f(x i ) supported on [0; 1]  d  . Define the order   Renyi entropy of f [7] H  (f) = 1 1   ln  Z  ...
