Trust and Partial Typing in Open Systems of Mobile Agents . We present a partially-typed semantics for Dp, a distributed p-calculus. The semantics is designed for mobile agents in open distributed systems in which some sites may harbor malicious intentions. Nonetheless, the semantics guarantees traditional type-safety properties at  good locations by using a mixture of static and dynamic type-checking. We show how the semantics can be extended to allow trust between sites, improving performance and expressiveness without compromising type-safety. 1 Introduction  In [13] we presented a type system for controlling the use of resources in a distributed system, or network. The type system guarantees two properties:  ffl resource access is always safe, e.g. integer resources are always accessed with integers and string resources are always accessed with strings, and  ffl resource access is always authorized, i.e. resources may only be accessed by agents that have been granted permission to do so. While these properties are desirable, they are prop...
