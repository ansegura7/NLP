Secure Multi-agent Dynamic Programming based on Homomorphic Encryption and its Application to Combinatorial Auctions This paper presents a secure dynamic programming protocol that utilizes homomorphic encryption. By using this method, multiple agents can solve a combinatorial optimization problem among them without leaking their private information. More specifically, in this method, multiple servers cooperatively perform dynamic programming procedures for solving a combinatorial optimization problem by using the private information sent from agents as inputs. Although the severs can compute the optimal solution correctly, the inputs are kept secret even from the servers.
