VOODOO: A Visual Object-Oriented Database Language for ODMG OQL This paper presents a simple and effective visual language to express ODMG OQL queries. The  language is expressive enough to allow most types of query nesting, aggregation, universal and existential  quantifications, group-by, and sorting, and at the same time is uniform and very simple to learn and  use. Our visual language is strongly typed in the sense that queries constructed in our system are always  type-correct. In addition, there is sufficient type information displayed by the system that guides every  stage of the query construction. The main difference between our language and other related visual query  languages is that we use only one generic visual construct, called a template, instead of inventing a new  one for each OQL syntactic feature.  1 Introduction  Query and data visualizations are key components of many commercial relational database systems, such as Microsoft Access and Paradox. Object-oriented databases offer excellent opportunities for visual data browsing b...
