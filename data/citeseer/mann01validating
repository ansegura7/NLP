Validating Access to External Information Sources in a Mediator Environment A mediator integrates existing information sources into a new application. In order to answer complex queries, the mediator splits them up into sub-queries which it sends to the information sources. Afterwards, it combines the replies to answer the original query. Since the information sources are usually external, autonomous systems, the access to them can sometimes be erroneous, most notably when the information source is changed. This results in an incorrect behaviour of the whole system. The question that this paper addresses, is: how to check whether or not the access was correct? The paper introduces a notational framework for the general information access validation problem, describes the typical errors that can occur in a mediator environment, and proposes several validation mechanisms. It is also investigated how the validation functionality can be integrated into the mediator architecture, and what the most important quality measures of a validation method are. Moreover, the practical usability of the presented approaches is demonstrated on a real-world application using Web-based information sources. Several measurements are performed to compare the presented methods with previous work in the field.
