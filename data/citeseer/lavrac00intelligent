Intelligent Data Analysis in Medicine Extensive amounts of knowledge and data stored in medical databases require the  development of specialized tools for storing and accessing of data, data analysis, and effective  use of stored knowledge and data. This paper focuses on methods and tools for  intelligent data analysis, aimed at narrowing the increasing gap between data gathering  and data comprehension. The paper sketches the history of research that led to the  development of current intelligent data analysis techniques, discusses the need for intelligent  data analysis in medicine, and proposes a classification of intelligent data analysis  methods. The scope of the paper covers temporal data abstraction methods and data  mining methods. A selection of methods is presented and illustrated in medical problem  domains. Presently data abstraction and data mining are attracting considerable research  interest. However the two technologies, in spite of the fact that they share their central  objective, namely the intelligen...
