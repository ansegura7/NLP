Simulating the Evolution of 2D Pattern Recognition on the CAM-Brain Machine, an Evolvable Hardware Tool for Building a 75 Million Neuron Artificial Brain This paper presents some simulation results of the evolution of 2D visual pattern recognizers to be implemented  very shortly on real hardware, namely the "CAM-Brain Machine" (CBM), an FPGA based piece of evolvable hardware  which implements a genetic algorithm (GA) to evolve a 3D cellular automata (CA) based neural network circuit  module, of approximately 1,000 neurons, in about a second, i.e. a complete run of a GA, with 10,000s of circuit  growths and performance evaluations. Up to 65,000 of these modules, each of which is evolved with a humanly  specified function, can be downloaded into a large RAM space, and interconnected according to humanly specified  artificial brain architectures. This RAM, containing an artificial brain with up to 75 million neurons, is then updated  by the CBM at a rate of 130 billion CA cells per second. Such speeds will enable real time control of robots and  hopefully the birth of a new research field that we call "brain building". The first such artif...
