Composable Agents for Patient Flow Control - Preliminary Concepts In this article we describe our research efforts in coping with a trade-off that can be often found in the control and optimization of todays business processes. Though centralized control may achieve better results in controlling the system behavior, there are usually social, technical and security constraints on applying centralized control. Distributed control on the other hand may cope with these constraints but also entails suboptimal results and communicational overhead. Our concept of composable agents tries to allow a dynamic and fluent transition between globalization and localization in business process control by adapting to the current real-world system structure. We are currently evaluating this concept in the framework of a patient flow control project at Charit'e Berlin. Todays applications of information technology face at least two major aspects of business settings. The first aspect is the partially or fully automated execution of complex business processes. This enfo...
