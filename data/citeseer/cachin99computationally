Computationally Private Information Retrieval with Polylogarithmic Communication We present a single-database computationally private information retrieval scheme with polylogarithmic communication complexity. Our construction is based on a new, but reasonable intractability assumption, which we call the \Phi-Hiding Assumption (\PhiHA): essentially the difficulty of deciding whether a small prime divides OE(m), where m is a composite integer of unknown factorization. Keywords: Integer factorization, Euler's function, \Phi-hiding assumption, private information retrieval. 1 Introduction Private information retrieval. The notion of private information retrieval (PIR for short) was introduced by Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz and Sudan [CGKS95] and has already received a lot of attention. The study of PIR is motivated by the growing concern about the user's privacy when querying a large commercial database. (The problem was independently studied by Cooper and Birman [CB95] to implement an anonymous messaging service for mobile users.) Ideally, the PIR problem consists...
