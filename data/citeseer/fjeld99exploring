Exploring Brick-Based Camera Control Introduction  BUILD-IT is a planning tool based on computer vision technology, with a capacity for complex planning and composition tasks (Rauterberg et al. 1997). The system enables users, grouped around a table, to interact in a virtual scene, using real bricks to select and manipulate objects in the scene (Fig. 1, left). A plan view of the scene is projected onto the table. A perspective view of the scene, called side view, is projected on the wall. The plan view contains a storage space with originals, allowing users to select new objects. Object selection is done by putting a brick at the object position. Once selected, objects can be positioned, rotated and fixed by simple brick manipulation (Fig. 1, right). They are de-selected, and stay put, when the brick is covered or removed. Objects brought back to the storage space are deleted.  Figure 1: BUILD-IT offers a plan view for combined action and perception, and a<F1
