Modeling Sociality In The BDI Framework . We present a conceptual model for how the social nature of agents impacts upon their individual mental states. Roles and social relationships provide an abstraction upon which we develop the notion of social mental shaping . 1 Introduction Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architectures for deliberative agents are based on the physical symbol system assumption that agents maintain and reason about internal representations of their world [2].
