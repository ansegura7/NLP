A Genetic Algorithm-Based Solution for the Problem of Small Disjuncts . In essence, small disjuncts are rules covering a small number of  examples. Hence, these rules are usually error-prone, which contributes to a  decrease in predictive accuracy. The problem is particularly serious because,  although each small disjuncts covers few examples, the set of small disjuncts  can cover a large number of examples. This paper proposes a solution to the  problem of discovering accurate small-disjunct rules based on genetic algorithms.  The basic idea of our method is to use a hybrid decision tree / genetic  algorithm approach for classification. More precisely, examples belonging to  large disjuncts are classified by rules produced by a decision-tree algorithm,  while examples belonging to small disjuncts are classified by a new genetic  algorithm, particularly designed for discovering small-disjunct rules.  1 Introduction  In the context of the well-known classification task of data mining, the discovered knowledge is often expressed as a set of IF-THEN predict...
