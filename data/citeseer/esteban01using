Using linear classifiers in the integration of user modeling and text content analysis in the personalization of a Web-based Spanish News Service Nowadays many newspapers and news agencies offer personalized  information access services and, moreover, there is a growing interest in the  improvement of these services. In this paper we present a methodology useful  to improve the intelligent personalization of news services and the way it has  been applied to a Spanish relevant newspaper: ABC. Our methodology  integrates textual content analysis tasks and machine learning techniques to  achieve an elaborated user model, which represents separately short-term needs  and long-term multi-topic interests. The characterization of a user's interests  includes his preferences about structure (newspaper sections), content and  information delivery. A wide coverage and non-specific-domain classification  of topics and a personal set of keywords allow the user to define his preferences  about content. Machine learning techniques are used to obtain an initial  representation of each category of the topic classification. Finally, we introduce  some details about the Mercurio system, which is being used to implement this  methodology for ABC. We describe our experience and an evaluation of the  system in comparison with other commercial systems.
