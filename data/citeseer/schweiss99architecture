An Architecture to Guide Crowds Using a Rule-Based Behavior System This paper describes a Client/Server architecture to combine the  control of human agents performing "intelligent actions" (guided by a Rule-Based Behavior System -- RBBS) with the management  of autonomous crowds which perform pre-programmed actions.  Our main goal being ability to model crowds formed by a large  number of agents (e.g. 1000), we have used pre-programmed  actions and basic behaviors. In addition, RBBS provides the user with an interface for real-time behavior control of some groups of  the crowd. This paper presents how the Server application deals  with virtual human agent's behaviors using a rule-based system.  Keywords  Multi-agent co-ordination and collaboration, agent architectures,  network agents, real-time performance, synthetic agents, rulebased  system, human crowds' model.  1. INTRODUCTION  Virtual humans grouped together to form crowds populating virtual worlds allow a more intuitive feeling of presence. However, the crowd is not only needed to create an at...
