Specifying Rational Agents with Statecharts and Utility Functions Abstract. To aid the development of the robotic soccer simulation league team RoboLog-2000, a method for the specification of multi-agent teams by statecharts has been introduced. The results in the last years competitions showed that though the team was competitive, it did not behave adaptive in unknown situations. The design of adaptive agents with this method is possible, but not in a straightforward manner. The purpose of this paper is to extend the approach by a more adaptive action selection mechanism and to facilitate a more explicit representation of goals of an agent. 1
