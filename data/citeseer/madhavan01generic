Generic Schema Matching with Cupid Schema matching is a critical step in many applications,  such as XML message mapping, data warehouse  loading, and schema integration. In this paper, we  investigate algorithms for generic schema matching,  outside of any particular data model or application. We  first present a taxonomy for past solutions, showing  that a rich range of techniques is available. We then  propose a new algorithm, Cupid, that discovers mappings  between schema elements based on their names,  data types, constraints, and schema structure, using a  broader set of techniques than past approaches. Some  of our innovations are the integrated use of linguistic  and structural matching, context-dependent matching  of shared types, and a bias toward leaf structure where  much of the schema content resides. After describing  our algorithm, we present experimental results that  compare Cupid to two other schema matching systems.
