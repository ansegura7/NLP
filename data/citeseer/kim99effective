Effective Temporal Aggregation using Point-based Trees . Temporal databases introduce the concept of time into underlying  data, and provide built-in facilities that allow users to store and  retrieve time-varying data. The aggregation in temporal databases, that  is, temporal aggregation is an extension of conventional aggregation on  the domain and range of aggregates to include time concept. Temporal  aggregation is important for various applications, but is very expensive.  In this paper, we propose a new tree structure for temporal aggregation,  called PA-tree, and aggregate processing method based on the PA-tree.  We show that the time complexity of the proposed method is better  than those of the existing methods. The time complexity of the proposed  method is shown to be indeed the lower bound of the problem. We  perform comparative experiments and show the performance advantage  of our proposed method in practice.  1 Introduction  While conventional database systems store the most recent snapshots of the real world, temporal datab...
