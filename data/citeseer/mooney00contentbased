We describe a content-based book recommending system that utilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text categorization. Initial experimental results demonstrate that this approach can produce accurate recommendations.  KEYWORDS: Recommender systems, information filtering,  machine learning, text categorization  INTRODUCTION  There is a growing interest in recommender systems that suggest music, films, books, and othe...
