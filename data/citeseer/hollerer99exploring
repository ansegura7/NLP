Exploring MARS: Developing Indoor and Outdoor User Interfaces to a Mobile Augmented Reality System We describe an experimental mobile augmented reality system (MARS) testbed that employs different user interfaces to allow outdoor and indoor users to access and manage information that is spatially registered with the real world. Outdoor users can experience spatialized multimedia presentations that are presented on a head-tracked, see-through, head-worn display used in conjunction with a hand-held pen-based computer. Indoor users can get an overview of the outdoor scene and communicate with outdoor users through a desktop user interface or a head- and hand-tracked immersive augmented reality user interface.  Key words: Augmented Reality. Wearable Computing. Mobile Computing. Hypermedia.  GPS.  1 Introduction  As computers increase in power and decrease in size, new mobile and wearable computing applications are rapidly becoming feasible, promising users access to online resources always and everywhere. This new flexibility makes possible a new kind of application---one that exploits ...
