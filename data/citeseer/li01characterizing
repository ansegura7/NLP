Characterizing Operating System Activity In Specjvm98 Benchmarks : Complete system simulation to understand the influence of architecture and  operating systems on application execution has been identified to be crucial for  systems design. This problem is particularly interesting in the context of Java  since it is not only the application that can invoke kernel services, but so does  the underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation which runs these  programs. Further, the JVM style (JIT compiler or interpreter) and the manner in  which the different JVM components (such as the garbage collector and class  loader) are exercised, can have a significant impact on the kernel activities. To  investigate these issues, this chapter uses complete system simulation of the  SPECjvm98 benchmarks on the SimOS simulation platform. The execution of  these benchmarks on both JIT compilers and interpreters is profiled in detail.  The kernel activity of SPECjvm98 applications constitutes up to 17% of the  execution time in the large dataset and up to 31% i...
