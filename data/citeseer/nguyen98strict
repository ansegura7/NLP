Strict Archimedean t-Norms and t-Conorms as Universal Approximators In knowledge representation, when we have to use logical connectives, various continuous t-norms and t-conorms are used. In this paper, we show that every continuous t-norm and t-conorm can be approximated, to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, by a strict Archimedean t-norm (t-conorm).

When we represent expert knowledge in expert systems and in intelligent control, it is important to adequately describe not only the experts' statements themselves, but also the experts' degrees of confidence in the corresponding statements. It is also important to adequately describe which operations with these degrees of confidence are best representing the expe...
