Fact or fiction: Content classification for digital libraries The World-Wide Web (WWW) is a vast repository of information, much of which is valuable  but very often hidden to the user. The anarchic nature of the WWW presents unique challenges  when it comes to information extraction and categorization. We view the WWW as a valuable  resource for the gathering of information for Digital Libraries. In this paper we will describe the  process of extracting and classifying information from the WWW for the purpose of integrating  it into digital libraries. Our eorts focus on ways to automatically classify news articles according  to whether they present opinions or reported facts. We describe and evaluate a system in  development that automatically classies and recommends Web news articles from sports and  politics domains.  1
