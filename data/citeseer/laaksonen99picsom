PicSOM - A Framework for Content-Based Image Database Retrieval using Self-Organizing Maps We have developed an image retrieval system which uses Tree Structured Self-Organizing Maps (TS-SOMs) as the method for retrieving images similar to a given set of reference images in a database. It also provides a framework for the research on algorithms and methods for contentbased retrieval of images. A novel technique introduced in this paper facilitates automatic combination of the responses from multiple TS-SOMs and their hierarchical levels. The system tries to adapt to the user's preferences in selecting which images resemble each other in the particular sense the user is interested of. This mechanism implements a relevance feedback technique on content-based image retrieval. The image queries are performed through the World Wide Web and the queries are iteratively re??ned as the system exposes more images to the user. 1 Introduction  Content-based image retrieval from unannotated image databases has been an object for ongoing research for a long period [12]. Digital image and v...
