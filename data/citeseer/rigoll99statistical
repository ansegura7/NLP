Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques for Multimodal Human Computer Interaction and Multimedia Information Processing This paper presents an extensive overview on statistical pattern recognition methods for a variety of different tasks, related to multimodal human-computer interaction and multimedia information processing. Typical tasks in the area of human-computer interaction include handwriting and gesture recognition, as well as pen-based retrieval of image databases. Multimedia information processing includes algorithms for document processing, video indexing or face recognition. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate to the speech community the usability of classical speech recognition algorithms, such as Hidden Markov Models and related statistical pattern recognition techniques, for a much larger variety of related problems in man-machine-communication and the ecient processing and retrieval of multimedia information.
