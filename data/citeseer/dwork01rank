Rank Aggregation Methods for the Web We consider the problem of combining ranking results from various sources. In the context of the Web, the main applications include building meta-search engines, combining ranking functions, selecting documents based on multiple criteria, and improving search precision through word associations. Wedevelop a set of techniques for the rank aggregation problem and compare their performance to that of well-known methods. A primary goal of our work is to design rank aggregation techniques that can effectively combat "spam," a serious problem in Web searches. Experiments show that our methods are simple, efficient, and effective.  Keywords: rank aggregation, ranking functions, metasearch, multi-word queries, spam  1.
