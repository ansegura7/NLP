HYMES: A HYbrid Modular Expert System with Efficient Inference and Explanation A HYbrid Modular Expert System, called HYMES, is presented. HYMES provides a dual representation scheme: a symbolic one, based on conventional symbolic rules, and a hybrid one, based on neumles, a kind of rules that combine a symbolic and a connectionist representation. Symbolic rules are internally converted into neumles, for efficiency reasons. In this way, hybrid modular knowledge bases can be constructed.
