Computational Intelligence Methods and Data Understanding Abstract. Experts in machine learning and fuzzy system frequently identify understanding the data with the use of logical rules. Reasons for inadequacy of crisp and fuzzy rule-based explanations are presented. An approach based on analysis of probabilities of classification p(Ci|X;??) as a function of the size of the neighborhood ?? of the given case X is presented. Probabilities are evaluated using Monte Carlo sampling or ??? for some models ??? using analytical formulas. Coupled with topographically correct visualization of the data in this neighborhood this approach, applicable to any classifiers, gives in many cases a better evaluation of the new data than rule-based systems. Two real life examples of such interpretation are presented. 1 Introduction. Classification and prediction are the two most common applications of computational intelligence (CI) methods, i.e. methods designed for solving problems that are effectively non-algorithmic. Although sometimes classification by a black box is sufficient ??? if it is reliable ??? domain experts use software to help them to understand
