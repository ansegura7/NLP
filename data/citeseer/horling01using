Using Self-Diagnosis to Adapt Organizational Structures The specific organization used by a multi-agent system is crucial for its effectiveness and efficiency. In dynamic environments, or when the objectives of the system shift, the organization must therefore be able to change as well. In this abstract we propose using a general diagnosis engine to drive this process of adaptation, using the TMS modeling language as the primary representation of organizational information. A complete version of this paper is at [1].  As the sizes of multi-agent systems grow in the number of their participants, the organization of those agents will be increasingly important. In such an environment, an organization is used to limit the range of control decisions agents must make, which is a necessary component of scalable systems. Are agent agents arranged in clusters, a hierarchy, a graph, or some other type of organization? Are the agents` activities or behaviors driven solely by local concerns, or do external peers or managers have direct influence as wel...
