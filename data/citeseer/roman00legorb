LegORB and Ubiquitous CORBA The increasing popularity of ubiquitous computing and the new approaches for low-consumption, shortrange wireless connectivity will enable a future with hundreds of heterogeneous devices interconnected to achieve a common task. However, communication among those network enabled heterogeneous devices requires standard protocols and well defined interfaces.  While existing middleware architectures already offer standard mechanisms (DCOM, CORBA, JINI), they are, in most of the cases, not suitable for most of the heterogeneous devices. The resources required by those middleware solutions normally exceed the computational limits of the heterogeneous devices  We present in this paper a minimalist component-based Object Request Broker (ORB) that can be dynamically reconfigured and requires, for the smallest configuration, 6Kb of memory.  Introduction  The incoming ubiquitous computing trend allows the existence of collections of network-enabled devices attached to rooms, people and buildings....
