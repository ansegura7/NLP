Visual Interpretation of Hand Gestures for Human-Computer Interaction: A Review The use of hand gestures provides an attractive alternative to cumbersome interface devices for human-computer interaction (HCI). In particular, visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for HCI. We survey the literature on vision-based hand gesture recognition within the context of its role in HCI. The number of approaches to video-based hand gesture recognition has grown in recent years. Thus, the need for systematization and analysis of different aspects of gestural interaction has developed. We discuss a complete model of hand gestures that possesses both spatial and dynamic properties of human hand gestures and can accommodate for all their natural types. Two classes of models that have been employed for interpretation of hand gestures for HCI are considered. The first utilizes 3D models of the human hand, while the second relies on the appearance of the human hand in the image. Investigation of model parameters and analysis feat...
