Introducing a New Advantage of Crossover: Commonality-Based Selection The Commonality-Based Crossover Framework defines crossover as a two-step process: 1) preserve the maximal common schema of two parents, and 2) complete the solution with a construction heuristic. In these ???heuristic ??? operators, the first step is a form of selection. This commonality-based form of selection has been isolated in GENIE. Using random parent selection and a non-elitist generational replacement scheme, GENIE does not include fitness-based selection. However, a theoretical analysis shows that ???ideal ??? construction heuristics in GENIE can potentially converge to optimal solutions. Experimentally, results show that the effectiveness of practical construction heuristics can be amplified by commonalitybased restarts. Overall, it is shown that the commonality hypothesis is valid--schemata common to above-average solutions are indeed above average. Since common schemata can only be identified by multi-parent operators, commonality-based selection is a unique advantage that crossover can enjoy over mutation. 1
