A Comparison Between Two Neural Network Rule Extraction Techniques for the Diagnosis of Hepatobiliary Disorders Neural networks have been widely used as tools for prediction in medicine. We  expect to see even more applications of neural networks for medical diagnosis as recently  developed neural network rule extraction algorithms make it possible for the  decision process of a trained network to be expressed as classification rules. These  rules are more comprehensible to a human user than the classification process of the  networks which involves complex nonlinear mapping of the input data. This paper  reports the results from two neural network rule extraction techniques, NeuroLinear  and NeuroRule applied to the diagnosis of hepatobiliary disorders. The data set consists  of nine measurements collected from patients in a Japanese hospital and these  measurements have continuous values. NeuroLinear generates piece-wise linear discriminant  functions for this data set. The continuous measurements have previously  been discretized by domain experts. NeuroRule is applied to the discretized data...
