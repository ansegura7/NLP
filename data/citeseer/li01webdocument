Web-Document Prediction And Presending Using Association Rule Sequential Classifiers An important data source for data mining is the web-log data that traces the user's web browsing actions. From the web logs, one can build prediction models that predict with high accuracy the user's next requests based on past behavior. To do this with the traditional classification and association rule methods will cause a number of serious problems due to the extremely large data size and the rich domain knowledge that must be applied. Most web log data are sequential in nature and exhibit the "most recent--most important" behavior. To overcome this difficulty, we examine two important dimensions of building prediction models, namely the type of antecedents of rules and the criterion for selecting prediction rules. This thesis proposes a better overall method for prediction model representation and refinement. We show empirically on realistic web log data that the proposed model dramatically outperforms previous ones. How to apply the learned prediction model to the task of presending web documents is also demonstrated.  iv  Dedication  To MY MOTHER only v  Acknowledgments  I would like to thank my senior supervisor, Dr. Qiang Yang, for his guidance, encouragement and invaluable advice during my research. His enthusiasm and devotion to research have given me great inspiration to accomplish this thesis. It would be hard to imagine finishing this thesis without his continuous support. My gratitude also goes to my supervisor Dr. Ke Wang and the external examiner, Dr. Jiawei Han, who share with me their boundless knowledge in the area of Data Mining, and provide me valuable feedback on my thesis.  I also gratefully acknowledge the unselfish help given to me by my old friend Henry Zhang. I have always learnt a lot from his amazing wisdom and creative thought over the crit...
