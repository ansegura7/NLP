Automatic Text Representation, Classification and Labeling in European Law The huge text archives and retrieval systems of legal information have not achieved yet the representation in the wellknown subject-oriented structure of legal commentaries. Content-based classification and text analysis remains a high priority research topic. In the joint KONTERM, SOM and LabelSOM projects, learning techniques of neural networks are used to achieve similar high compression rates of classification and analysis like in manual legal indexing. The produced maps of legal text corpora cluster related documents in units that are described with automatically selected descriptors. Extensive tests with text corpora in European case law have shown the feasibility of this approach. Classification and labeling proved very helpful for legal research. The Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map represents very interesting generalities and specialties of legal text corpora. The segmentation into document parts improved very much the quality of labeling. The next challenge would be a change from tfxidf vector representation to a modified vector representation taking into account thesauri or ontologies considering learned properties of legal text corpora.
