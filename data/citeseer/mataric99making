Making Complex Articulated Agents Dance - An analysis of control methods drawn from robotics, animation, and biology .  We discuss the tradeoffs involved in control of complex articulated agents, and present three implemented controllers for a complex task: a physically-based humanoid torso dancing the Macarena. The three controllers are drawn from animation, biological models, and robotics, and illustrate the issues of joint-space vs. Cartesian space task specification and implementation. We evaluate the controllers along several qualitative and quantitative dimensions, considering naturalness of movement and controller flexibility. Finally, we propose a general combination approach to control, aimed at utilizing the strengths of each alternative within a general framework for addressing complex motor control of articulated agents.  Key words: articulated agent control, motor control, robotics, animation 1. Introduction  Control of humanoid agents, dynamically simulated or physical, is an extremely difficult problem due to the high dimensionality of the control space, i.e., the many degrees of freed...
