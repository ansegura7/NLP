A Feasible Low-Power Augmented-Reality Terminal This paper studies the requirements for a truly wearable augmented-reality (AR) terminal. The requirements translate into a generic hardware architecture consisting of programmable modules communicating through a central interconnect. Careful selection of low-power components shows that it is feasible to construct an AR terminal that weighs about 2 kg and roughly dissipates 26 W. With stateof -the-art batteries and a 50% average resource utilization, the terminal can operate for about 10 hours. 1. Introduction  The goal of ubiquitous computing is to have computers act as "human assistants" that support us instantly. Computers should move out of our awareness instead of being at the center of our attention [14]. For ubiquitous computing to become reality we need two important technologies to mature: wireless communication (wearability) and augmented reality (user-interface). Wireless communication is obviously required to obtain services provided by an arbitrary computer regardless the ...
