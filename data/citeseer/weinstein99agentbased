Agent-Based Digital Libraries: Decentralization and Coordination This paper describes agent-based systems and explains why digital libraries should be built with this type of architecture. The primary advantage of agent-based architecture is decentralization, which enables scaling, flexibility, and extensibility. The corresponding requirement is the need to coordinate agent activity. We describe the approach taken by the University of Michigan Digital Library project.  2  1 Introduction Digital libraries are just beginning to evolve. No one is certain what capabilities are needed, nor how they should be organized. It is therefore important to design digital libraries to be as open as possible, so that new collections and services can be easily added to the system. Furthermore, it is essential that libraries be able to scale to become quite large. For us, this implies a decentralized architecture, where there are few if any shared resources and where as much decision making is done as locally as possible. An example of such a distributed system is t...
