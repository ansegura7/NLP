On the Expressiveness of Event Notification in Data-driven Coordination Languages JavaSpaces and TSpaces are two coordination middlewares for distributed Java programming recently proposed by Sun and IBM, respectively. They extend the data-driven coordination model of Linda with an event notification mechanism: a process can register interest in the incoming arrivals of a particular kind of data and receive communication of the occurrences of these events. In [2, 3] we introduce a process calculus L, based on the Linda coordination model, and we prove that if processes are synchronous with the dataspace (ordered interpretation) L is Turing powerful, while this is not the case if they are asynchronous (unordered interpretation). Here, we introduce a new calculus Ln , obtained by extending L with the event noti cation mechanism, and we prove two main results contrasting with what has been shown for L: (i) Ln is Turing powerful also under the unordered interpretation and (ii) it allows a faithful encoding of the ordered semantics on top of the unordered one.
