Optimal Design of Neural Nets Using Hybrid Algorithms Selection of the topology of a network and correct parameters for the  learning algorithm is a tedious task for designing an optimal Artificial Neural  Network (ANN), which is smaller, faster and with a better generalization  performance. Genetic algorithm (GA) is an adaptive search technique based on  the principles and mechanisms of natural selection and survival of the fittest  from natural evolution. Simulated annealing (SA) is a global optimization  algorithm that can process cost functions possessing quite arbitrary degrees of  nonlinearities, discontinuities and stochasticity but statistically assuring a  optimal solution. In this paper we explain how a hybrid algorithm integrating  the desirable aspects of GA and SA can be applied for the optimal design of an  ANN. This paper is more concerned with the understanding of current  theoretical developments of Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANNs)  using GAs and other heuristic procedures and how the proposed hybrid and  other heuristic procedures can be combined to produce an optimal ANN.
