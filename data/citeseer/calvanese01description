Description Logics for Information Integration Information integration is the problem of combining the data residing at different, heterogeneous sources, and providing the user with a unified view of these data, called mediated schema. The mediated schema is therefore a reconciled view of the information, which can be queried by the user. It is the task of the system to free the user from the knowledge on where data are, and how data are structured at the sources.
