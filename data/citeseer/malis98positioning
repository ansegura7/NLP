Positioning a coarse-calibrated camera with respect to an unknown object by 2D 1/2 visual servoing In this paper we propose a new vision-based robot control approach halfway between the classical positionbased and image-based visual servoings. It allows to avoid their respective disadvantages. The homography between some planar feature points extracted from two images (corresponding to the current and desired camera poses) is computed at each iteration. Then, an approximate partial-pose, where the translational term is known only up to a scale factor, is deduced, from which can be designed a closed-loop control law controlling the six camera d.o.f.. Contrarily to the position-based visual servoing, our scheme does not need any geometric 3D model of the object. Furthermore and contrarily to the image-based visual servoing, our approach ensures the convergence of the control law in all the task space.
