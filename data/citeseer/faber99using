Using Database Optimization Techniques for Nonmonotonic Reasoning In this paper a program rewriting technique for disjunctive datalog is proposed, which descends from query optimization techniques in relational algebra and reduces the size of the ground instantiation of a program in many cases. As a consequence, the time for generating the ground instantiation and the time for subsequent operations on the ground program is shortened. A part of this technique has already been implemented as a preprocessing step in the Disjunctive Deductive Database System dlv. Using a recently published application, we show that a signicant reduction of the ground program size and a tremendous overall speedup can be achieved. 1 Introduction dlv is a Disjunctive Deductive Database System implementing the Consistent Answer Sets Semantics. Like similar systems in the area of non-monotonic reasoning [6], the kernel modules of dlv operate on a ground instantiation of the input program, i.e., a program that does not contain any variables, but is (semantically) equivalent t...
