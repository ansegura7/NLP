A General Framework for Evolving Schemata Support . In this paper a semantic approach for the specication and the management of  databases with evolving schemata is introduced. It is shown how a general object-oriented  model for schema versioning and evolution can be formalised; how the semantics of schema  change operations can be dened; how interesting reasoning tasks can be supported, based  on an encoding in description logics.  1 Introduction  The problems of schema evolution and versioning arose in the context of long-lived database applications, where stored data were considered worth surviving changes in the database schema [23]. According to a widely accepted terminology [19], a database supports schema evolution if it permits modications of the schema without the loss of extant data; in addition, it supports schema versioning if it allows the querying of all data through user-denable version interfaces. For the sake of brevity, schema evolution can be considered as a special case of schema versioning where only the curr...
