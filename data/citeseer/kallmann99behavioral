A Behavioral Interface to Simulate Agent-Object Interactions in Real Time This paper shows a new approach to model and control interactive objects for simulations with virtual human  agents when real time interactivity is essential. A general conceptualization is made to model objects with behaviors that can provide: information about their functionality, changes in appearance from parameterized deformations, and a complete plan for each possible interaction with a virtual human. Such behaviors are  described with simple primitive commands, following the actual trend of many standard scene graph file formats that connects language with movements and events to create interactive animations. In our case, special attention is given to correctly interpret object behaviors in parallel: situation that arrives when many human  agents interact at the same time with one same object.  Keywords: Virtual Humans, Virtual Environments, Object Modeling, Object Interaction, Script Languages, Parameterized Deformations.  1 Introduction  The necessity to have interactive obje...
