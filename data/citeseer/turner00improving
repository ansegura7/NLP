Improving the Scalability of Multi-agent Systems . There is an increasing demand for designers and developers  to construct ever larger multi-agent systems. Such systems will be composed  of hundreds or even thousands of autonomous agents. Moreover,  in open and dynamic environments, the number of agents in the system  at any one time will uctuate signicantly. To cope with these twin  issues of scalability and variable numbers, we hypothesize that multiagent  systems need to be both self-building (able to determine the most  appropriate organizational structure for the system by themselves at runtime)  and adaptive (able to change this structure as their environment  changes). To evaluate this hypothesis we have implemented such a multiagent  system and have applied it to the domain of automated trading.  Preliminary results supporting the rst part of this hypothesis are presented:  adaption and self-organization do indeed make the system better  able to cope with large numbers of agents.  1 Introduction  When designing or buildin...
