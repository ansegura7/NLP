DrawCAD: Using Deductive Object-Relational Databases in CAD Computer-Aided Design (CAD) involves the use of computers in the various stages of engineering design. It has large volumes of data with complex structures that needs to be stored and managed efficiently and properly. In CAD, graphical objects with complex structures can be created by reusing previously created objects. The data of these objects have the references to the other objects they contain. Deductive object-relational databases can be used to compute the complete data of graphical objects that reuse other objects. This is the idea behind the development of the DrawCAD system. DrawCAD is a CAD system built on top of the Relationlog object-relational deductive database system. It facilitates the creation of graphical objects by reusing previously created objects. The DrawCAD system illustrates how CAD systems can be developed, using deductive object-relational databases to store and manage data and also perform the computations that are normally performed by the application program.
