Efficient Identification of Web Communities We dene a community on the web as a set of sites that have more links (in either direction) to members of the community than to non-members. Members of such a community can be eciently identied in a maximum ow / minimum cut framework, where the source is composed of known members, and the sink consists of well-known non-members. A focused crawler that crawls to a xed depth can approximate community membership by augmenting the graph induced by the crawl with links to a virtual sink node. The effectiveness of the approximation algorithm is demonstrated with several crawl results that identify hubs, authorities, web rings, and other link topologies that are useful but not easily categorized. Applications of our approach include focused crawlers and search engines, automatic population of portal categories, and improved ltering.
