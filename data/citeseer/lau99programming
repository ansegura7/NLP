Programming by Demonstration: An Inductive Learning Formulation Although Programming by Demonstration (PBD) has the potential to improve the productivity of unsophisticated users, previous PBD systems have used brittle, heuristic, domain-specific approaches to execution-trace generalization. In this paper we define two applicationindependent methods for performing generalization that are based on well-understood machine learning technology.  TGen vs uses version-space generalization, and  TGen foil is based on the FOIL inductive logic programming  algorithm. We analyze each method both theoretically and empirically, arguing that TGen vs has lower sample complexity, but TGen foil can learn a much more interesting class of programs.  Keywords  Programming by Demonstration, machine learning, inductive logic programming, version spaces  INTRODUCTION  Computer users are largely unable to customize massproduced applications to fit their individual tasks. This problem of end-user customization has been addressed in several ways.  ffl Adjustable preference...
