Improving Business Process Quality through Exception Understanding, Prediction, and Prevention Business process automation technologies are  being increasingly used by many companies to  improve the efficiency of both internal processes  as well as of e-services offered to customers. In  order to satisfy customers and employees,  business processes need to be executed with a  high and predictable quality. In particular, it is  crucial for organizations to meet the Service  Level Agreements (SLAs) stipulated with the  customers and to foresee as early as possible the  risk of missing SLAs, in order to set the right  expectations and to allow for corrective actions.  In this paper we focus on a critical issue in  business process quality: that of analyzing,  predicting and preventing the occurrence of  exceptions, i.e., of deviations from the desired or  acceptable behavior. We characterize the  problem and propose a solution, based on data  warehousing and mining techniques. We then  describe the architecture and implementation of a  tool suite that enables exception analysis,  prediction, and prevention. Finally, we show  experimental results obtained by using the tool  suite to analyze internal HP processes.  1.
