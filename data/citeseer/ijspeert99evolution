Evolution and Development of a Central Pattern Generator for the Swimming of a Lamprey This paper describes the design of neural control architectures for locomotion using an evolutionary approach. Inspired by the central pattern generators found in animals, we develop neural controllers which can produce the patterns of oscillations necessary for the swimming of a simulated lamprey. This work is inspired by Ekeberg's neuronal and mechanical model of a lamprey [11], and follows experiments in which swimming controllers were evolved using a simple encoding scheme [26, 25]. Here, controllers are developed using an evolutionary algorithm based on the SGOCE encoding [31, 32] in which a genetic programming approach is used to evolve developmental programs which encode the growing of a dynamical neural network. The developmental programs determine how neurons located on a 2D substrate produce new cells through cellular division and how they form efferent or afferent interconnections. Swimming controllers are generated when the growing networks eventually create connections to ...
