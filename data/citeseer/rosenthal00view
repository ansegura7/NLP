View Security as the Basis for Data Warehouse Security Access  .  permissions in a data warehouse are  currently managed in a separate world from  the sources' policies. The consequences are  inconsistencies, slow response to change, and  wasted administrative work. We present a  different approach, which treats the sources'  exported tables and the warehouse as part of  the same distributed database. Our main result  is a way to control derived products by  extending SQL grants rather than creating  entirely new mechanisms. We provide a  powerful, sound inference theory that derives  permissions on warehouse tables (both  materialized and virtual), making the system  easier to administer and its applications more  robust. We also propose a new permission  construct suitable for views that filter data  from mutually-suspicious parties.  1 Introduction  A key challenge for data warehouse security is how to manage the entire system coherently -- from sources and their export tables, to warehouse stored tables  (conventional and cubes) and vi...
