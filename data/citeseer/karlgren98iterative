Iterative Information Retrieval Using Fast Clustering and Usage-Specific Genres This paper describes how collection specific empirically defined stylistics based genre prediction can be brought together together with rapid topical clustering to build an interactive information retrieval interface with multi-dimensional presentation of search results. The prototype presented addresses two specific problems of information retrieval: how to enrich the information seeking dialog by encouraging and supporting iterative refinement of queries, and how to enrich the document representation past the shallow semantics allowed by term frequencies.  Searching For More Than Words  Today's tools for searching information in a document database are based on term occurrence in texts. The searcher enters a number of terms and a number of documents where those terms or closely related terms appear comparatively frequently are retrieved and presented by the system in list form. This method works well up to a point. It is intuitively understandable, and for competent users and well e...
