Implementation and Performance Analysis of Incremental Equations for Nested Relations View materialization is an important way of improving the  performance of query processing. When an update occurs to  the source data from which a materialized view is derived, the  materialized view has to be updated so that it is consistent  with the source data. This update process is called view maintenance.  The incremental method of view maintenance, which  computes the new view using the old view and the update to  the source data, is widely preferred to full view recomputation  when the update is small in size. The small update size  becomes an important concept for measuring the cheap performance  of the incremental methods. In this paper, we investigate  what is the limit of the small update size, which we call  size limit for the incremental maintenance. When the size of  an update exceeds the limit, the incremental maintenance is no  longer cheaper than the view recomputation. The investigation  is based on incremental equations for operators in the nested  relational model...
