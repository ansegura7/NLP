Social Mental Shaping: Modelling the Impact of Sociality on the Mental States of Autonomous Agents This paper presents a framework that captures how the social nature of agents that are situated in a multi-agent environment impacts upon their individual mental states. Roles and social relationships provide an abstraction upon which we develop the notion of social mental shaping. This allows us to extend the standard Belief-DesireIntention model to account for how common social phenomena (e.g. cooperation, collaborative problem-solving and negotiation) can be integrated into a unified theoretical perspective that reflects a fully explicated model of the autonomous agent's mental state.  Keywords: Multi-agent systems, agent interactions, BDI models, social influence.  3  1.
