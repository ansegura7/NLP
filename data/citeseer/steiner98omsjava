OMS/Java: Model Extensibility of OODBMS for Advanced Application Domains . We showhow model extensibility of object-oriented data  management systems can be achieved through the combination of a highlevel  core object data model and an architecture designed with model  extensibility in mind. The resulting system, OMS#Java, is both a general  data management system and a framework for the developmentof  advanced database application systems. All aspects of the core model #  constructs, query language and constraints # can easily be generalised to  support, for example, the management of temporal, spatial and versioned  data. Speci#cally,we showhow the framework was used to extend the  core system to a temporal object-oriented database management system.  1 Introduction  Extensibility has often been considered a purely architectural issue in database management systems #DBMS#. In the 1980s, there was an increase in the various forms of DBMS that appeared --- many of whichwere tailored to speci#c application domains such as Geographical Information Systems or ...
