Using Diagnosis to Learn Contextual Coordination Rules Knowing when and how to communicate and coordinate with other agents in a multi-agent system is an important efficiency and reliability question. Contextual rules governing this communication must be provided to the agent, or generated at runtime through environmental analysis. In this paper we describe how the TAEMS task modeling language is used to encode such contextual coordination rules, and how runtime diagnosis can be used to dynamically update them. Overview  Communication and coordination is an essential component of most complex multi-agent systems. Contention over shared resources, the desire to employ remote information and the need to coordinate interrelated activities may each require some sort of information transfer between agents to be resolved. To this end, individual actors in a multi-agent system must be able to explicitly or implicitly communicate requests and results, desires and beliefs, to make the system an efficient and cohesive unit. Thus, a set of situation-...
