Appearance-Based Obstacle Detection with Monocular Color Vision This paper presents a new vision-based obstacle detection  method for mobile robots. Each individual image pixel is  classified as belonging either to an obstacle or the ground  based on its color appearance. The method uses a single  passive color camera, performs in real-time, and provides a  binary obstacle image at high resolution. The system is  easily trained by simply driving the robot through its  environment. In the adaptive mode, the system keeps  learning the appearance of the ground during operation. The  system has been tested successfully in a variety of  environments, indoors as well as outdoors.  1. Introduction  Obstacle detection is an important task for many mobile robot applications. Most mobile robots rely on range data for obstacle detection. Popular sensors for range-based obstacle detection systems include ultrasonic sensors, laser rangefinders, radar, stereo vision, optical flow, and depth from focus. Because these sensors measure the distances from obstacles t...
