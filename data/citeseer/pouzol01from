From Declarative Signatures to Misuse IDS In many existing misuse intrusion detection systems, intrusion  signatures are very close to the detection algorithms. As a consequence,  they contain too many cumbersome details. Recent work have  proposed declarative signature languages that raise the level of abstraction  when writing signatures. However, these languages do not always  come with operational support. In this article, we show how to transform  such declarative signatures into operational ones. This process points  out several technical details which must be considered with care when  performing the translation by hand, but which can be systematically  handled.
