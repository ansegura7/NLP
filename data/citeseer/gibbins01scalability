Scalability Issues for Query Routing Service Discovery In this paper, we discuss the relationship between mediatorbased systems for service discovery in multi-agent systems, and the technique of query routing used for resource discovery in distributed information systems. We then construct a model of the query routing task which we use to examine the complexity and scalability characteristics of a number of commonly encountered architectures for resource or service discovery.
