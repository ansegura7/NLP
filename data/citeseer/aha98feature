Feature Weighting for Lazy Learning Algorithms :  Learning algorithms differ in the degree to which they process their inputs prior to their use in performance tasks. Many algorithms eagerly compile input samples and use only the compilations to make decisions. Others are lazy: they perform less precompilation and use the input samples to guide decision making. The performance of many lazy learners significantly degrades when samples are defined by features containing little or misleading information. Distinguishing feature relevance is a critical issue for these algorithms, and many solutions have been developed that assign weights to features. This chapter introduces a categorization framework for feature weighting approaches used in lazy similarity learners and briefly surveys some examples in each category. 1.1 INTRODUCTION  Lazy learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms (Mitchell, 1997) that are welcome members of procrastinators anonymous. Purely lazy learners typically display the following characteristics (Aha, 19...
