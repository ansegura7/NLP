&lt;bigwig&gt; -- A language for developing interactive Web services &lt;bigwig&gt; is a high-level programming language and a compiler for developing interactive Web services. The overall goal of the language design is to remove many of the obstacles that face current developers of Web services in order to lower cost while increasing functionality and reliability. The compiler translates programs into a conglomerate of lower-level standard technologies such as CGI-scripts, HTML, JavaScript, and HTTP Authentication. This paper describes the major facets of the language design and the techniques used in their implementation, and compares the design with alternative Web service technologies.
