Functional Join Processing . Inter-object references are one of the key concepts of object-relational and object-oriented database systems. In this work, we investigate alternative techniques to implement inter-object references and make the best use of them in query processing, i.e., in evaluating functional joins. We will give a comprehensive overview and performance evaluation of all known techniques for simple (singlevalued) as well as multi-valued functional joins. Furthermore, we will describe special order-preserving functionaljoin techniques that are particularly attractive for decision support queries that require ordered results. While most of the presentation of this paper is focused on object-relational and object-oriented database systems, some of the results can also be applied to plain relational databases because index nested-loop joins along key/foreign-key relationships, as they are frequently found in relational databases, are just one particular way to execute a functional join.  Key words: O...
