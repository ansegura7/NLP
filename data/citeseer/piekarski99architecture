An Architecture for Outdoor Wearable Computers to Support Augmented Reality and Multimedia Applications This paper describes an architecture to support a hardware and software platform for research into the use of wearable computers and augmented reality in an outdoor environment. The architecture supports such devices as a GPS, compass, and head-mounted display. A prototype system was built to support novel applications by drawing graphics (such as maps, building plans, and compass bearings) on the head-mounted display, projecting information over that normally seen by the user and hence augmenting a user's perception of reality. This paper presents a set of novel augmented reality and multimedia applications operated in an outdoor environment.  1
