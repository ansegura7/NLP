Mobile Agents for Information Integration . The large amount of information that is spread over the Internet is an  important resource for all people but also introduces some issues that must be  faced. The dynamism and the uncertainty of the Internet, along with the heterogeneity  of the sources of information are the two main challanges for the  today's technologies. This paper proposes an approach based on mobile agents  integrated in an information integration infrastructure. Mobile agents can significantly  improve the design and the development of Internet applications thanks  to their characteristics of autonomy and adaptability to open and distributed environments,  such as the Internet. MOMIS (Mediator envirOnment for Multiple  Information Sources) is an infrastructure for semi-automatic information integration  that deals with the integration and query of multiple, heterogeneous information  sources (relational, object, XML and semi-structured sources). The aim of  this paper is to show the advantage of the introduction in the MOMIS infrastructure  of intelligent and mobile software agents for the autonomous management  and coordination of the integration and query processes over heterogeneous data  sources.  1
