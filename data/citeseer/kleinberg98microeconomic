A Microeconomic View of Data Mining We present a rigorous framework, based on optimization, for evaluating data mining operations such as associations and clustering, in terms of their utility in decisionmaking. This framework leads quickly to some interesting computational problems related to sensitivity analysis, segmentation and the theory of games.

There is some agreement in the literature on what qualifies as a "pattern" (association rules and correlations [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 20, 21] as well as clustering of the data points [9], are ...
