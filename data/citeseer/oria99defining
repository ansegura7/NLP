Defining Views In An Image Database System : A view mechanism can help handle the complex semantics in emerging  application areas such as image databases. This paper presents the view  mechanism we defined for the DISIMA image database system. Since DISIMA is  being developed on top of an object-oriented database system, we first propose  apowerful object-oriented view mechanism based on the separation between  types (interface functions) and classes that manage objects of the same type.  The image view mechanism uses our object-oriented view mechanism to allow  us to give differentsemantics to the same image. The solution is based on the  distinction between physical salient objects which are interesting objects in an  image and logical salient objects which are the meanings of these objects.  14.1 INTRODUCTION  Views have been widely used in relational database management systems to extend modeling capabilities and to provide data independence. Basically, views in a relational database can be seen as formulae defining virtua...
