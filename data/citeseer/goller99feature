Feature Extraction and Learning Vector Quantization for Data Structures During the last years, folding architecture networks and the closely related concept of recursive neural networks have been developed for solving supervised learning tasks on data structures. In this paper we address the fundamental problem of finding fixedlength vector representations for structures in an unsupervised way. A solution based on ideas from feature extraction and folding architecture networks is proposed. Furthermore, a new method for supervised learning for data structures which combines ideas from learning vector quantization and folding architecture networks is suggested. 1 Introduction  In almost all fields of scientific and technical reasoning, people and systems assisting them have to deal with structured objects . Examples are chemical structures, algebraic (mathematical) expressions and formulas, software source code, and conceptual and taxonomic graphs. With structured objects we mean objects which are composed of `smaller' objects, which may be structured too. T...
