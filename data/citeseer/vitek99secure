Secure Mobile Code: The JavaSeal experiment Mobile agents are programs that move between sites during execution to benefit from the services and information present at each site. To gain wide acceptance, strong security guarantees must be given: sites must be protected from malicious agents and agents must be protected from each other. Software based protection is widely viewed as the most efficient way of enforcing agent security. In the first part of the paper, we review programming language support for security. This review also helps to highlight weaknesses in the Java security model. In the second part of the paper, we make good on the lessons learned in the review to design a security architecture for the JavaSeal agent platform.  1 Introduction  Wide area networks such as the Internet hold the promise of a brave new wired world of global computing. The hope is to have distributed applications that scale to the size of the Internet and seamlessly provide access to massive amounts of information and value added services. Bu...
