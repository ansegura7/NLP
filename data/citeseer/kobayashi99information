Information Retrieval on the Web: Selected Topics In this paper we review studies on the growth of the Internet and technologies which are useful for information search and retrieval on the Web. In the rst section, we present data on the Internet from several dierent sources, e.g., current as well as projected number of users, hosts and Web sites. Although the numerical gures vary, the overall trends cited by the sources are consistent and point to exponential growth during the coming decade. And Internet users are increasingly using search engines and search services to nd speci c information of interest. However, users are not satis ed with the performance of the current generation of search engines; the slow speed of retrieval, communication delays, and poor quality of retrieved results (e.g., noise and broken links) are commonly cited problems. The main body of our paper focuses on linear algebraic models and techniques for solving these problems. keywords: clustering, indexing, information retrieval, Internet, late...
