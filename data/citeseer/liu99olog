Deductive object-oriented databases are intended to combine  the best of the deductive and object-oriented approaches. However,  some important object-oriented features are not properly supported in  the existing proposals. This paper proposes a novel deductive language  that supports important structurally object-oriented features such as  object identity, complex objects, typing, classes, class hierarchies, multiple  property inheritance with overriding, conict-handling, and blocking,  and schema denitions in a uniform framework. The language eectively  integrates useful features in deductive and object-oriented database languages.  The main novel feature is the logical semantics that cleanly accounts  for those structurally object-oriented features that are missing in  object-oriented database languages. Therefor...
