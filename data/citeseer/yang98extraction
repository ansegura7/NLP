Extraction and Classification of Visual Motion Patterns for Hand Gesture Recognition We present a new method for extracting and classifying motion patterns to recognize hand gestures. First, motion segmentation of the image sequence is generated based on a multiscale transform and attributed graph matching of regions across frames. This produces region correspondences and their affine transformations. Second, color information of motion regions is used to determine skin regions. Third, human head and palm regions are identified based on the shape and size of skin areas in motion. Finally, affine transformations defining a region's motion between successive frames are concatenated to construct the region's motion trajectory. Gestural motion trajectories are then classified by a time-delay neural network trained with backpropagation learning algorithm. Our experimental results show that hand gestures can be recognized well using motion patterns.  1 Introduction  This paper is concerned with the problem of detecting two-dimensional motion across image frames and classifyi...
