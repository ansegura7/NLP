Implementing a Knowledge Date-a-Base Knowledge-based systems are very useful, but can be  dicult to design because of the complexity of the realworld  knowledge they represent. This paper compares  the experiences of building the same knowledge base by  hand in two dierent systems, Otter and CLIPS. The  knowledge base considered is that of people's preferences  towards others, in the interests of nding a \dating  match." Finally, this paper considers Horn theorems  and their impact on the usefulness of knowledge  systems.  Introduction  Because technology and automation are increasingly becoming a part of everyday life, it is benecial to enable technology to \understand" its application area. An obvious way of doing this is to implement and embed a knowledge base in an application. However, designing a good knowledge base is not trivial. A good knowledge base needs to be general so it can be reused, complete to avoid bad models, and ecient in description and time.  This paper presents the authors' experiences implement...
