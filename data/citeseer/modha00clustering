Clustering Hypertext With Applications To Web Searching : Clustering separates unrelated documents and groups related documents, and is useful for discrimination, disambiguation, summarization, organization, and navigation of unstructured collections of hypertext documents. We propose a novel clustering algorithm that clusters hypertext documents using words (contained in the document), out-links (from the document) , and in-links (to the document). The algorithm automatically determines the relative importance of words, out-links, and in-links for a given collection of hypertext documents. We annotate each cluster using six information nuggets: summary, breakthrough, review, keywords, citation, and reference. These nuggets constitute high-quality information resources that are representatives of the content of the clusters, and are extremely effective in compactly summarizing and navigating the collection of hypertext documents. We employ web searching as an application to illustrate our results. Keywords: cluster annotation, feature comb...
