A Logical Framework for Multi-Agent Systems and Joint Attitudes We present a logical framework for reasoning about multi-agent systems. This framework uses Giunchiglia et al.'s notion of a logical context to define a methodology for the modular specification of agents and systems of agents. In particular, the suggested methodology possesses important features from the paradigm of object-oriented (OO) design. We are particularly interested in the specification of agent behaviours via BDI theories---i.e., theories of belief, desire and intention. We explore various issues arising from the BDI specification of systems of agents and illustrate how our framework can be used to specify bottom-level agent behaviour via the specification of top-level intentions, or to reason about complex "emergent behaviour" by specifying the relationship between simple interacting agents.  1 Introduction  The formal specification of autonomous reasoning agents has recently received much attention in the AI community, particular under the paradigm of agent-oriented progr...
