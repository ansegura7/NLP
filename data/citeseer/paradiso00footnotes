FootNotes: Personal Reflections on the Development of Instrumented Dance Shoes and their Musical Applications This paper describes experiences in designing and developing an extremely  versatile, multimodal sensor interface built entirely into a pair of shoes. I discuss the  system design, trace its motivations and goals, then describe its applications in  interactive music for dance performance, summarizing lessons learned and future  possibilities.  ____________________________________  1) The Inspiration  Although the idea of instrumenting shoes for interactive music performance had crossed my mind before, the moment at which I decided to pursue this project can be traced to a demonstration that I attended with my Media Lab colleague Tod Machover in November of 1996. We were visiting some of our research sponsors and colleagues at a Yamaha development laboratory in the Shinjuku section of Tokyo, where they showed us the latest version of their Miburi musical controller [1]. The Miburi is an electronic vest, with bend sensors at various joints to monitor dynamic articulation and a pair of ha...
