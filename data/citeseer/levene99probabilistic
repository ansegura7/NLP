A Probabilistic Approach to Navigation in Hypertext One of the main unsolved problems confronting Hypertext is the navigation problem, namely the problem of having to know where you are in the database graph representing the structure of a Hypertext database, and knowing how to get to some other place you are searching for in the database graph. Previously we formalised a Hypertext database in terms of a directed graph whose nodes represent pages of information. The notion of a trail, which is a path in the database graph describing some logical association amongst the pages in the trail, is central to our model. We defined a Hypertext Query Language, HQL, over Hypertext databases and showed that in general the navigation problem, i.e. the problem of finding a trail that satisfies a HQL query (technically known as the model checking problem), is NPcomplete. Herein we present a preliminary investigation of using a probabilistic approach in order to enhance the efficiency of model checking. The flavour of our investigation is that if we h...
