Updating Extended Logic Programs through Abduction . This paper introduces techniques for updating knowledge bases represented in extended logic programs. Three di#erent types of updates, view updates, theory updates, and inconsistency removal, are considered. We formulate these updates through abduction, and provide methods for computing them with update programs. An update program is an extended logic program which specifies changes on abductive hypotheses, then updates are computed by the U-minimal answer sets of an update program. The proposed technique provides a uniform framework for these di#erent types of updates, and each update is computed using existing procedures of logic programming. 1 Introduction A knowledge base must be updated when new information arrives. There are three cases in updating a knowledge base. The first one is that a knowledge base contains two di#erent kinds of knowledge --- variable knowledge and invariable knowledge. In this case, updates are permitted only on variable knowledge. Updates on the invari...
