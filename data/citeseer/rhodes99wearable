Wearable Computing Meets Ubiquitous Computing: Reaping the best of both worlds This paper describes what we see as fundamental diculties in both the pure ubiquitous computing and pure wearable computing paradigms when applied to context-aware applications. In particular, ubiquitous computing and smart room systems tend to have dif- culties with privacy and personalization, while wearable systems have trouble with localized information, localized resource control, and resource management between multiple people. These diculties are discussed, and a peer-to-peer network of wearable and ubiquitous computing components is proposed as a solution. This solution is demonstrated through several implemented applications.  1 Introduction  Ubiquitous computing and wearable computing have been posed as polar opposites even though they are often applied in very similar applications. Here we rst outline the advantages and disadvantages of each and propose that the two perspectives have complementary problems. We then attempt to demonstrate that the failing of both ubiquitous...
