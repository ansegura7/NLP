Requirements for an Architecture for Embodied Conversational Characters In this paper we describe the computational and architectural requirements for systems which support real-time multimodal interaction with an embodied conversational character. We argue that the three primary design drivers are real-time multithreaded entrainment, processing of both interactional and propositional information, and an approach based on a functional understanding of human face-toface conversation. We then present an architecture which meets these requirements and an initial conversational character that we have developed who is capable of increasingly sophisticated multimodal input and output in a limited application domain.  1 Introduction  Research in computational linguistics, multimodal interfaces, computer graphics, and autonomous agents has led to the development of increasingly sophisticated autonomous or semi-autonomous virtual humans over the last five years. Autonomous self-animating characters of this sort are important for use in production animation, interfa...
