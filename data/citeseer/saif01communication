Communication Primitives for Ubiquitous Systems or RPC Considered Harmful RPC is widely used to access and modify remote state. Its procedural call semantics are argued as an efficient unifying paradigm for both local and remote access. Our experience with ubiquitous device control systems has shown otherwise. RPC semantics of a synchronous, blocking invocation on a statically typed interface are overly restrictive, inflexible, and fail to provide an efficient unifying abstraction for accessing and modifying state in ubiquitous systems. This position paper considers other alternatives and proposes the use of comvets (conditional, mobility aware events) as the unifying generic communication paradigm for such systems.  Keywords: RPC, RMI, Events, Comvets, CORBA, Jini  1 Introduction  Ubiquitous environments or active spaces are the next generation of device control networks. A user interacts with an active space by using novel interfaces like speech and gesture input [1] to control her environment, and the system interacts with the user using audio/video outpu...
