Temporal Matching under Uncertainty Temporal matching is the problem of matching  observations to predefined temporal patterns  or templates. This problem arises  in many applications including medical and  model-based diagnosis, plan-recognition, and  temporal databases. This work examines the  sources of uncertainty in temporal matching  and presents a probabilistic technique to perform  temporal matching under uncertainty.  This technique is then applied to the problem  of finding the onset of infection with Toxoplasma   Gondii.  1 Introduction  Temporal matching is the process of matching a limited set of observations to known temporal evolution patterns in order to identify the stage of evolution or determine the onset of the temporally evolving pattern. Given a sequence of observations, and some temporal evolution patterns, a temporal match consistent with the sequence of observations maps observation times to particular points in a pattern.  Formally, S is a set of states, TR is the set of time points measured rel...
