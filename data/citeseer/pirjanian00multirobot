Multi-Robot Target Acquisition using Multiple Objective Behavior Coordination In this paper we propose an approach to multi-robot coordination in the context of cooperative target acquisition. The approach is based on multiple objective behavior coordination extended to multiple robots. It provides mechanisms for distributed command fusion across a group of robots to pursue multiple goals of multiple robots in parallel. The mechanisms enable each robot to select actions that not only benefit itself but also benefit the group as a whole. Experimental results with two mobile robots validate that, by using this method, a group of robots can successfully track and acquire a moving target. 1 Introduction Cooperation of a team of robots in unknown settings poses complex control problems which require solutions that guarantee a suitable trade-off between a multitude of (potentially) conflicting task objectives within and among the robots. For instance, an action that is optimal with respect to a particular robot might be unacceptable with respect to the others. Thus ...
