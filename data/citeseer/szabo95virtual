A Virtual Reality based System Environment for Intuitive Walk-Throughs and Exploration of Large-Scale Tourist Information This paper describes the concept and prototype architecture for Virtual Reality (VR) based Information Systems (ViRXIS). ViRXIS may serve as a base architecture for different kind of IS domains, such as a VR based Tourist Information System (ViRTIS) or a VR based Geographic Information System (ViRGIS). Finally, potential application scenarios of ViRTIS will be presented.

Introduction The ever increasing computing power and storage capacity of low-cost computer systems enables the implementation of multimedia applications that integrate different media such as text, image, graphics, voice, music, computer animation, or video for the presentation and manipulation of tourist information. At present, the userinterface of  such multimedia-based Tourist Informati...
