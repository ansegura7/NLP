A Hybrid Decision Tree/genetic Algorithm for Coping With the Problem of Small Disjuncts in Data Mining The problem of small disjuncts is a serious  challenge for data mining algorithms. In essence,  small disjuncts are rules covering a small  number of examples. Due to their nature, small  disjuncts tend to be error prone and contribute to  a decrease in predictive accuracy. This paper  proposes a hybrid decision tree/genetic algorithm  method to cope with the problem of small  disjuncts. The basic idea is that examples  belonging to large disjuncts are classified by  rules produced by a decision-tree algorithm,  while examples belonging to small disjuncts  (whose classification is considerably more  difficult) are classified by rules produced by a  genetic algorithm specifically designed for this  task.  1 INTRODUCTION  In the context of the well-known classification task of data mining, the discovered knowledge is often expressed as a set of IF-THEN rules, since this kind of knowledge representation is intuitive for the user. From a logical viewpoint, typically the discovered rules ar...
