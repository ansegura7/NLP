LART: flexible, low-power building blocks for wearable computers To ease the implementation of different wearable computers, we developed a low-power processor board (named LART) with a rich set of interfaces. The LART supports dynamic voltage scaling, so performance (and power consumption) can be scaled to match demands: 59-221 MHz, 106-640 mW. High-end wearables can be configured from multiple LARTs operating in parallel; alternatively, FPGA boards can be used for dedicated data-processing, which reduces power consumption significantly.
