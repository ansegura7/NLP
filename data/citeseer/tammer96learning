Learning Case Classification for Improving Case-Based Reasoning this paper, we consider unconstrained graphs which may be either directed or undirected and, possibly, labelled or unlabelled. Computing structural similarity is essentially based on graph matching which actually means computing subgraph isomorphism. This subproblem is known to be NP-complete. It becomes more tractable when using labelled and directed graphs. The particular approach developed and investigated throughout the present workshop presentation can be easily generalized to other structural similarity concepts. For readability, we confine ourselves to graph representations. Because of NP-completeness of the subgraph isomorphism problem, classical case retrieval is extremely expensive, if every member of a usually huge case base is potentially queried. The performance of this search can be increased enormously by prestructuring the case base in case classes, i.e. clustering. Preferably, a given case base CB is clustered with respect to structural similarity, i.e. graphs of a close structural relationship are grouped together and represented by the graph(s) describing their common structural similarity. Let us assume that any given  case base CB is separated in n partitions or classes. Each class CB i (i = 1; :::; n) consists of a set of graph-represented cases and is determined by a graph \Theta
