Semantic Approaches to Structuring and Querying Web Sites In order to pose effective queries to Web sites, some form of site data model must be implicitly or explicitly shared by users. Many approaches try to compensate for the lack of such a common model by considering the hypertextual structure of Web sites; unfortunately, this structure has usually little to do with data semantics. In this paper a different technique is proposed that allows for both navigational and logical/conceptual description of Web sites. The data model is based on WG-log, a query language based on the graph-oriented database model of GOOD [Gys94] and G-log [Par95], which allows the description of data manipulation primitives via (sets of) graph(s). The WG-log description of a Web site schema is lexically based on standard hypermedia design languages, thus allowing for easy schema generation by current hypermedia authoring environments. The use of WG-log for queries allows graphic query construction with respect to both the navigational and the logical parts of schema...
