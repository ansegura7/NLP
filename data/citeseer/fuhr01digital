Digital Libraries: A Generic Classification and Evaluation Scheme Evaluation of digital libraries (DLs) is essential for further  development in this area. Whereas previous approaches were restricted to  certain facets of the problem, we argue that evaluation of DLs should be  based on a broad view of the subject area. For this purpose, we develop  a new description scheme using four major dimensions: data/collection,  system/technology, users, and usage. For each of these dimensions, we  describe the major attributes. Using this scheme, existing DL test beds  can be characterised. For this purpose, we have performed a survey by  means of a questionnaire, which is now continued by setting up a DL  meta-library.
