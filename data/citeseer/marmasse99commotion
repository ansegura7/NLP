comMotion: a context-aware communication system How many times have you gone to the grocery store but left the grocery list on the refrigerator door? Wouldn't it be more efficient to have a reminder to buy groceries and the shopping list delivered to you when you were in the vicinity of the store?  We live in a world in which the information overload is part of our daily life. Many of us receive large quantities of email or voice mail messages. Yet many of these messages are relevant only in a particular context. We can use a system of reminders to keep up with all we have to do, but these reminders are often relevant only to a specific location. If reminders, to-do lists, messages and other information were delivered in the most timely and relevant context, part of the overload would be reduced. This paper describes comMotion, a context-aware communication system for a mobile or wearable computing platform.  Keywords  Mobile, ubiquitous and wearable computing; locationaware, context-aware applications.
