CHIME: Customizable Hyperlink Insertion and Maintenance Engine for Software Engineering Environments Source code browsing is an important part of program comprehension. Browsers expose semantic and syntactic relationships (such as between object references and definitions) in GUI-accessible forms. These relationships are derived using tools which perform static analysis on the original software documents. Implementing such browsers is tricky. Program comprehension strategies vary, and it is necessary to provide the right browsing support. Analysis tools to derive the relevant crossreference relationships are often difficult to build. Tools to browse distributed documents require extensive coding for the GUI, as well as for data communications. Therefore, there are powerful motivations for using existing static analysis tools in conjunction with WWW technology to implement browsers for distributed software projects. The chime framework provides a flexible, customizable platform for inserting HTML links into software documents using information generated by existing software analysis tools. Using the chime specification language, and a simple, retargetable database interface, it is possible to quickly incorporate a range of different link insertion tools for software documents, into an existing, legacy software development environment. This enables tool builders to offer customized browsing support with a well-known GUI. This paper describes the chime architecture, and describes our experience with several re-targeting efforts of this system. 1
