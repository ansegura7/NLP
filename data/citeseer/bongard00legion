The Legion System: A Novel Approach to Evolving Heterogeneity for Collective Problem Solving . We investigate the dynamics of agent groups evolved to perform  a collective task, and in which the behavioural heterogeneity of the  group is under evolutionary control. Two task domains are studied: solutions  are evolved for the two tasks using an evolutionary algorithm called  the Legion system. A new metric of heterogeneity is also introduced,  which measures the heterogeneity of any evolved group behaviour. It  was found that the amount of heterogeneity evolved in an agent group  is dependent of the given problem domain: for the rst task, the Legion  system evolved heterogeneous groups; for the second task, primarily homogeneous  groups evolved. We conclude that the proposed system, in  conjunction with the introduced heterogeneity measure, can be used as  a tool for investigating various issues concerning redundancy, robustness  and division of labour in the context of evolutionary approaches to collective  problem solving.  1 Introduction  Investigations into heterogeneous a...
