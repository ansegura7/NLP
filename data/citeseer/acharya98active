Active Disks Several application and technology trends indicate that it might be both profitable and feasible to move computation closer to the data that it processes. In this paper, we evaluate Active Disk architectures which integrate significant processing power and memory into a disk drive and allow application-specific code to be downloaded and executed on the data that is being read from (written to) disk. The key idea is to offload bulk of the processing to the disk-resident processors and to use the host processor primarily for coordination, scheduling and combination of results from individual disks. To program Active Disks, we propose a stream-based programming model which allows disklets to be executed efficiently and safely. Simulation results for a suite of seven algorithms from three application domains (commercial data warehouses, image processing and satellite data processing) indicate that for these algorithms, Active Disks outperform conventional-disk architectures. 1 Introduction...
