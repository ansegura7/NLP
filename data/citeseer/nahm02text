Text Mining with Information Extraction The popularity of the Web and the large number of documents available in electronic form has motivated the search for hidden knowledge in text collections. Consequently, there is growing research interest in the general topic of text mining. In this paper, we develop a text-mining system by integrating methods from Information Extraction (IE) and Data Mining (Knowledge Discovery from Databases or KDD). By utilizing existing IE and KDD techniques, text-mining systems can be developed relatively rapidly and evaluated on existing text corpora for testing IE systems. We present a general text-mining framework called DiscoTEX which employs an IE module for transforming natural-language documents into structured data and a KDD module for discovering prediction rules from the extracted data. When discovering patterns in extracted text, strict matching of strings is inadequate because textual database entries generally exhibit variations due to typographical errors, misspellings, abbreviations, and other
