Multi-Agent Support for Internet-Scale Grid Management Internet-scale computational grids are emerging from various research projects. Most notably are the US National Technology  Grid and the European Data Grid projects. One specific problem in realizing wide-area distributed computing  environments as proposed in these projects, is effective management of the vast amount of resources that are made  available within the grid environment. This paper proposes an agent-based approach to resource management in grid  environments, and describes an agent infrastructure that could be integrated with the grid middleware layer. This agent  infrastructure provides support for mobile agents that is scalable in the number of agents and the number of resources.
