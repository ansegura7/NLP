Decentralized Incremental Maintenance of Multi-View Data Warehouses (Extended Abstract) )  I. Stanoi D. Agrawal A.

Presently, their size increases due to the necessity of more detailed information, and the extended time range of interest. As a result, data mining queries also span larger sets of data. To achieve fast response time, a subset of the relevant information is sometimes materialized in views, separate from the database sources [4]. A data warehouse is an example of storage that integrates information from multiple sources, which may be stand-alone databases as well as sites such as the Internet. Although data warehousing is a powerful concept for supporting analytical processing, building a data warehouse runs into several pragmatic problems. The cost of building a data warehouse that integrates disparate data sources in an organization can easily exceed millions of dollars. A more sev...
