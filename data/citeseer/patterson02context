A Context for Assisted Cognition Assisted Cognition is introduced as an idea which leverages four technologies, ubiquitous computing, state reduction, plan recognition and decision theory, to develop solutions to problems faced by Alzheimer patients and their caregivers. A patient population with General Dementia Scale rating of less than 4 is targeted, and user interface methods from clinical studies are identified. A review of the literature on the component technologies is surveyed and a general architecture for Assisted Cognition is described.
