The Isomorphism Between a Class of Place Transition Nets and a Multi-Plane State Machine Agent Model Recently we introduced a multi-plane state machine model of an agent, released an implementation  of the model, and designed several applications of the agent framework. In this paper  we address the translation from the Petri net language to the Blueprint language used for agent  description as well as the translation from Blueprint to Petri Nets. The simulation of a class  of Place Transition Nets is part of an effort to create an agent--based workflow management  system.
