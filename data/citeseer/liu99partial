Partial and Complete Tuples and Sets in Deductive Databases . In a nested relational or complex object database, nested tuples and sets are used to represent real world objects. For various reasons, such tuples and sets can be partial or complete. In this paper, we discuss how to support them in deductive databases. In particular, we present a deductive database language RLOG  II  that supports partial and complete tuples and sets based on Relationlog. This work provides a firm logical foundation for nested relational and complex object databases that have both partial and complete tuples and sets. 1 Introduction  In a nested relational database or complex object database, nested tuples and sets are used to represent real world objects. A relation is just a set of tuples and a database is a tuple of relations. For various reasons, the information about real world objects in a database may be incomplete. Hence, both tuples and sets can be partial or complete. In the past several years, a sub-problem, that is, a database which contains partial an...
