A systematic classification of replicated database protocols based on atomic broadcast Database replication protocols based on group communication primitives have recently emerged as a promising technology to improve database faulttolerance and performance. Roughly speaking, this approach consists in exploiting the order and atomicity properties provided by group communication primitives or, more specifically Atomic Broadcast, to guarantee transaction properties. This paper proposes a systematic classification of non voting database replication algorithms based on Atomic Broadcast. 1.
