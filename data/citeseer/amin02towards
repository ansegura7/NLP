Towards Resource Efficient and Scalable Routing: An Agent-based Approach Mobile Agents are being proposed for an increasing variety of applications. Agent mobility can be exploited to implement a scalable system level solutions. Network routing is one such domain that can benefit from an agent-based approach. Shortest Path Routing algorithms enjoy a widespread use in most communication networks. However, large amounts of routing data exchanged in these algorithms consume substantial bandwidth, making conventional routing schemes less scalable.
