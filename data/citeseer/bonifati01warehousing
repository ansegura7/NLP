Warehousing Workflow Data: Challenges and Opportunities Workflow management systems (WfMSs) are  software platforms that allow the definition,  execution, monitoring, and management of  business processes. WfMSs log every event that  occurs during process execution. Therefore,  workflow logs include a significant amount of  information that can be used to analyze process  executions, understand the causes of high- and  low-quality process executions, and rate the  performance of internal resources and business  partners. In this paper we present a packaged  data warehousing solution, coupled with HP  Process Manager, for collecting and analyzing  workflow execution data. We first present the  main challenges involved in this effort, and then  detail the proposed approach.  1.
