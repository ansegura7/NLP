Information agents on the move: A survey on load-balancing with mobile agents Information agents process and integrate heterogeneous, distributed information. To achieve this task efficiently, some researchers promote the idea of mobile information agents [13, 53, 44, 20, 10], which migrate between a user's host and other hosts in the network. We outline the concepts behind mobile information agents and give a survey on load balancing, which aims to optimise distributed information processing.
