Multidimensional Data Modeling for Complex Data Systems for On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) considerably ease the process of analyzing business  data and have become widely used in industry. OLAP systems primarily employ multidimensional  data models to structure their data. However, current multidimensional data models fall short in their  ability to model the complex data found in some real-world application domains. The paper presents  nine requirements to multidimensional data models, each of which is exemplified by a real-world, clinical  case study. A survey of the existing models reveals that the requirements not currently met include  support for many-to-many relationships between facts and dimensions, built-in support for handling  change and time, and support for uncertainty as well as different levels of granularity in the data. The  paper defines an extended multidimensional data model, which addresses all nine requirements. Along  with the model, we present an associated algebra, and outline how to implement the model using relational  databases.
