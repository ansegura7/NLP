Democratic Data Fusion for Information Retrieval Mediators Our research presented in this paper concerns the problem of fusing the results returned by the underlying systems to a mediating retrieval system, also called meta-retrieval system, meta-search engine, or mediator. We propose a fusion technique which is based solely on the actual results returned by each system for each query. The final (fused) ordering of documents is derived by aggregating the orderings of each system in a democratic manner. In addition, the fused ordering is accompanied by a level of democracy (alternatively construed as the level of confidence).
