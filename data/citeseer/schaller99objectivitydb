Objectivity/DB Benchmark Objectivity read/write benchmarks and storage overhead measurements are presented. Keywords:  1 Introduction  Most of the coming HEP experiments will use object-oriented database management systems (ODBMSs) as data store. A detailed understanding of the the ODBMS performance is crucial to enable highperformance analysis scenarios. This paper presents performance measurements for di#erent access patterns using the commercial ODBMS Objectivity/DB. Measurements were made for sequential reading, sequential writing and selective reading. Furthermore an experimental and analytical analysis of the storage overhead introduced by Objectivity/DB is given. The ODBMS performance depends on the underlying data medium. At the moment there are no alternatives to hard drives for secondary storage existing. Although the performance/price ratios of both processors and disks are improving, the rate of improvement is greater for processors. Hence, the disk subsystem is emerging as a bottleneck factor in s...
