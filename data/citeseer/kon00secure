Secure Dynamic Reconfiguration of Scalable CORBA Systems with Mobile Agents . As various Internet services, electronic commerce, and information and communication systems permeate our lives, their continual availability becomes a dominant issue. But continuing software evolution requires system recon guration. Running systems must upgrade their components or change their con guration parameters. In addition, Internet services often need to serve thousands or millions of users. This scenario raises three conicting issues that need to be resolved: availability, con gurability, and scalability. We propose the use of mobile recon guration agents for the ecient, secure, and scalable dynamic recon guration of Internet systems. In our system, the agents are deployed within the object-oriented architecture of a CORBA-compliant ORB that supports safe recon guration both of its middleware engine and of user applications. Using a graphical front-end, administrators build recon guration agents and specify the topology of the recon guration network the agents traverse to recon gure the distributed system on-the-y. The agents collect, group, and return the results of inspection and recon guration operations in the distributed system to the administrator. 1
