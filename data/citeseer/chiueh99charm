Charm: An I/O-Driven Execution Strategy for High-Performance Transaction Processing The performance of a transaction processing system whose database is not completely  memory-resident critically depends on the amount of physical disk I/O required. This  paper describes a high-performance transaction processing system called Charm, which  aims to reducing the concurrency control overhead by minimizing the performance impacts  of disk I/O on lock contention delay. In existing transaction processing systems, a  transaction blocked by lock contention is forced to wait while the transaction currently  holding the contended lock is performing physical disk I/O. A substantial portion of a  transaction's lock contention delay is thus attributed to disk I/Os performed by other  transactions. Charm implements a two-stage transaction execution (TSTE) strategy,  which makes sure that all the data pages that a transaction needs be memory-resident  before it is allowed to lock database pages. Moreover, Charm supports an optimistic  version of the TSTE strategy (OTSTE), which furth...
