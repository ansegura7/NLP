Anatural offshoot of the growing prevalence of online auctions is the creation of autonomous bidding agents that monitor and participate in these auctions. It is straightforward to write a bidding agent to participate in an online auction for a single good, particularly when the value of that good is fixed ahead of time: the agent can bid slightly over the ask price until the auction closes or the price exceeds the value.
