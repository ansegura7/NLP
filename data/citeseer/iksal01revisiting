Revisiting and Versioning in Virtual Special Reports Adaptation/personalization is one of the main issues for web  applications and require large repositories. Creating adaptive web applications  from these repositories requires to have methods to facilitate web application  creation and management and to ensure reuse, sharing and exchange of data  through the internet/intranet. Virtual documents deal with these issues. In our  framework, we are interested in adaptive virtual documents for author-oriented  web applications providing several reading strategies to readers. These  applications have the following characteristics: authors have know-how which  enables them to choose document contents and to organize them in one or more  consistent ways. A reading strategy and the corresponding content are  semantically coherent and convey a particular meaning to the readers. Such  author's know-how can be represented at knowledge level and then be used for  generating web documents dynamically, for ensuring reader comprehension and  for sharing and reuse. Then an adaptive virtual document can be computed on  the fly by means of a semantic composition engine using: i) an overall  document structure -- for instance a narrative structure - representing a reading  strategy for which node contents are linked at run time, according to user's  needs for adaptation, ii) an intelligent search engine and semantic metadata  relying on semantic web initiative, and iv) a user model. In this paper, we focus  on a semantic composition engine enabling us to compute on the fly  adaptive/personalized web documents in the ICCARS project. Its main goal is  to assist the journalist in building adaptive special reports. In such a framework,  adaptation, personalization and reusability are central issues for delivering  adaptive special reports.
