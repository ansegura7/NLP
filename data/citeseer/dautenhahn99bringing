Bringing up Robots or - The Psychology of Socially Intelligent Robots: From Theory to Implementation We discuss robotic experiments in a framework based on theories in developmental psychology. 1 Introduction  Piaget's theory of cognitive development has strongly influenced many approaches in artificial intelligence and agent research. His theory has been challenged from various directions, and recent experiments have confirmed Vygotsky's belief in the essential role of social interaction and teaching as a scaffolding mechanism which is important for the child in order to reach higher levels of competence and control based on current skills. Hereby concepts are not taught directly but through social interaction, the child's experiences are re-arranged, a shared understanding develops between the child and its interaction partner.
