Motivation-Based Direction of Planning Attention in Agents With Goal Autonomy The action of an agent with goal autonomy will be driven by goals generated with reference to its own beliefs and desires. This ability is essential for agents that are required to act in their own interests in a domain that is not entirely predictable. At any time, the situation may warrant the generation of new goals. However, it is not always the case that changes in the domain that lead to the generation of a goal are detected immediately before the goal should be pursued. Action may not be appropriate for some time. Furthermore, an agent may be influenced by goals that tend to recur periodically, or at particular times of the day or week for example. Such goals serve to motivate an agent towards interacting with other agents or processes with certain types of predictable behaviour patterns. This thesis provides a model of a goal autonomous agent that may generate goals in response to unexpected changes in its domain or cyclically through automatic processes. An important effect of...
