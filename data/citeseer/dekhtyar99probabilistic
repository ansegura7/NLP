Probabilistic Temporal Databases, I: Algebra Dyreson and Snodgrass have drawn attention to the fact that in many temporal database applications,  there is often uncertainty present about the start time of events, the end time of events, the duration of  events, etc. When the granularity of time is small (e.g. milliseconds), a statement such as "Packet p  was shipped sometime during the first 5 days of January, 1998" leads to a massive amount of uncertainty  (5 \Theta 24 \Theta 60 \Theta 60 \Theta 1000)possibilities. As noted in [53], past attempts to deal with uncertainty in databases  have been restricted to relatively small amounts of uncertainty in attributes. Dyreson and Snodgrass have  taken an important first step towards solving this problem.  In this paper, we first introduce the syntax of Temporal-Probabilistic (TP) relations and then show  how they can be converted to an explicit, significantly more space-consuming form called Annotated  Relations. We then present a Theoretical Annotated Temporal Algebra (TATA). Being e...
