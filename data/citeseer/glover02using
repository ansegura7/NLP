Using Web Structure for Classifying and Describing Web Pages The structure of the web is increasingly being used to improve organization, search, and analysis  of information on the web. For example, Google uses the text in citing documents (documents that  link to the target document) for search. We analyze the relative utility of document text, and the text  in citing documents near the citation, for classification and description. Results show that the text in  citing documents, when available, often has greater discriminative and descriptive power than the text  in the target document itself. The combination of evidence from a document and citing documents  can improve on either information source alone. Moreover, by ranking words and phrases in the citing  documents according to expected entropy loss, we are able to accurately name clusters of web pages,  even with very few positive examples. Our results confirm, quantify, and extend previous research using  web structure in these areas, introducing new methods for classification and description of pages.
