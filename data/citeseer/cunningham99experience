Experience with a Language Engineering Architecture: Three Years of GATE GATE, the General Architecture for Text Engineering, aims to provide a software infrastructure for researchers and developers working in the area of natural language processing. A version of GATE has now been widely available for three years. In this paper we review the objectives which motivated the creation of GATE and the functionality and design of the current system. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the current system, identify areas for improvement and present plans for implementing these improvements. Introduction  We think that if you're researching human language processing you should probably not be writing code to: ffl store data on disk;  ffl display data;  ffl load processor modules and data stores into processes;   ffl initiate and administer processes;  ffl divide computation between client and server;  ffl pass data between processes and machines. A Domain-Specific Software Architecture (DSSA) for language processing should do all this for you. You will have t...
