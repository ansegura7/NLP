Processing of Spatiotemporal Queries in Image Databases Overlapping Linear Quadtrees is a structure suitable for storing consecutive raster images according to transaction time (a database of evolving images). This structure saves considerable space without sacrificing time performance in accessing every single image. Moreover, it can be used for answering efficiently window queries for a number of consecutive images (spatio-temporal queries). In this paper, we present three such temporal window queries: strict containment, border intersect and cover. Besides, based on a method of producing synthetic pairs of evolving images (random images with specified aggregation) we present empirical results on the I/O performance of these queries.
