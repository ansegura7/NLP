Location Systems for Ubiquitous Computing To serve us well, emerging mobile computing applications will need to know the physical location of things so that they can record them and report them to us: What lab bench was I standing by when I prepared these tissue samples? How should our search-and-rescue team move to quickly locate all the avalanche victims? Can I automatically display this stock devaluation chart on the large screen I am standing next to? Researchers are working to meet these and similar needs by developing systems and technologies that automatically locate people, equipment, and other tangibles. Indeed, many systems over the years have addressed the problem of automatic location-sensing. Because each approach solves a slightly different problem or supports different applications, they vary in many parameters, such as the physical phenomena used for location determination, the form factor of the sensing apparatus, power requirements, infrastructure versus portable elements, and resolution in time and space. To make sense of this domain, we have developed a taxonomy to help developers
