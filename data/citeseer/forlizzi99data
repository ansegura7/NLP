A Data Model and Data Structures for Moving Objects Databases We consider spatio-temporal databases supporting spatial objects with continuously  changing position and extent, termed moving objects databases. We formally  define a data model for such databases that includes complex evolving spatial  structures such as line networks or multi-component regions with holes. The data  model is given as a collection of data types and operations which can be plugged  as attribute types into any DBMS data model (e.g. relational, or object-oriented)  to obtain a complete model and query language. A particular novel concept is the  sliced representation which represents a temporal development as a set of units,  where unit types for spatial and other data types represent certain "simple" functions  of time. We also show how the model can be mapped into concrete physical  data structures in a DBMS environment.  1 Introduction  A wide and increasing range of database applications has to deal with spatial objects whose position and/or extent changes over time...
