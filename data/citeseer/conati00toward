Toward Computer-Based Support of Meta-Cognitive Skills: a Computational Framework to Coach Self-Explanation this paper, we describe how these solutions have been implemented in a computer tutor that coaches self-explanation within Andes, a tutoring system for Newtonian physics. We also present the results of a formal study to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the system. Finally, we discuss some hypotheses to explain the obtained results, based on the analysis of the data collected during the study.  INTRODUCTION  Research on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) has been increasingly affecting education. While for many years ITS remained confined to research labs, today they have started moving into the classroom, showing their effectiveness for learning and influencing the structure of traditional curricula (Koedinger, Anderson, H., & Mark, 1995). However, existing ITS still target only a limited part of the learning process. They generally focus on teaching problem solving and domain specific cognitive skills.  The long-term goal of our research is to explore innovat
