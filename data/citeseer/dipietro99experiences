Experiences in the use of Mobile Agents for developing distributed applications Introduction  The recent development of telecommunication networks has contributed to the success of distributed systems, and has stimulated the research for a new generation of applications, such as the access to remote databases, the Web, and e-commerce. Traditional programming in distributed systems has been based on the well-known client/server paradigm. An alternative to such traditional mechanisms has recently been spreading, and is based on the use of environments that give a sort of "code mobility" [2]. By this term we mean the possibility to change dynamically at run-time the binding between the software components of an application and their physical location within a network of computers.  Code mobility is the main feature on which mobile agent systems are based: a mobile agent can be deemed as a software module able to autonomously perform the task assigned by the user, by moving (if necessary) from a node of the network to the other, in order to collect the informa
