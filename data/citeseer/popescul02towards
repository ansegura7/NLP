Towards Structural Logistic Regression: Combining Relational and Statistical Learning Inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques are useful for analyzing data in multi-table relational databases. Learned rules can potentially discover relationships that are not obvious in ``flattened'' data. Statistical learners, on the other hand, are generally not constructed to search relational data, they expect to be presented with a single table containing a set of feature candidates. However, statistical learners often yield more accurate models than the logical forms of ILP, and can better handle certain types of data, such as counts. We propose a new approach which integrates structure navigation from ILP with regression modeling. Our approach propositionalizes the first-order rules at each step of ILP's relational structure search, generating features for potential inclusion in a regression model. Ideally, feature generation by ILP and feature selection by stepwise regression should be integrated into a single loop. Preliminary results for scientific literature classification are presented using a relational form of the data extracted by ResearchIndex (formerly CiteSeer). We use FOIL and logistic regression as our ILP and statistical components (decoupled at this stage). Word counts and citation-based features learned with FOIL are modeled together by logistic regression. The combination often significantly improves performance when high precision classification is desired.
