Optimization Techniques For Queries with Expensive Methods Object-Relational database management systems allow knowledgeable users to de ne new data types, as well as new methods (operators) for the types. This exibility produces an attendant complexity, which must be handled in new ways for an Object-Relational database management system to be e cient. In this paper we study techniques for optimizing queries that contain time-consuming methods. The focus of traditional query optimizers has been on the choice of join methods and orders; selections have been handled by \pushdown " rules. These rules apply selections in an arbitrary order before as many joins as possible, using the assumption that selection takes no time. However, users of Object-Relational systems can embed complex methods in selections. Thus selections may take signi cant amounts of time, and the query optimization model must be enhanced. In this paper, we carefully de ne a query cost framework that incorporates both selectivity and cost estimates for selections. We develop an algorithm called Predicate Migration, and prove that it produces optimal plans for queries with expensive methods. We then describe our implementation of Predicate Migration in the commercial Object-Relational database management system Illustra, and discuss practical issues that a ect our earlier assumptions. We compare Predicate Migration to a variety of simpler optimization techniques, and demonstrate that Predicate Migration is the best general solution to date. The alternative techniques we presentmaybe useful for constrained workloads.
