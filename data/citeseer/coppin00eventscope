EventScope: Amplifying Human Knowledge and Experience via Intelligent Robotic Systems and Information Interaction The EventScope program develops publicly accessible "reality browsers" that display both archived and updating representations of remote environments derived from on-site robotic sensors. The interface encourages collaborative work within a community of users. Public exploration of real remote sites presents a variety of interface issues addressed by EventScope, including time delay, public exploration via a single robot and communication between geographically separate users from diverse backgrounds. Merging public interface with educational and contextual information extends the notion of "interface" to "remote reality library." EventScope is a NASA and private foundationfunded project based at Carnegie Mellon University. 1. Introduction  Publicly funded Earth and planetary exploration is conducted to increase knowledge of our universe. The public traditionally accesses this knowledge passively, through the media. However, the development of the Web and of robotic remote-sensing tech...
