Ruling Agent Motion in Structured Environments . The design and development of cooperative Internet applications  based on mobile agents require appropriate modelling of both the physical  space where agents roam and the conceptual space of mobile agent interaction.  The paper discusses how an open, Internet-based, organisation network can be  modelled as a hierarchical collection of locality domains, where agents can  dynamically acquire information about resource location and availability  according to their permissions. It also analyses the issue of how agent motion  can be ruled and constrained within a structured environment by means of an  appropriate coordination infrastructure.  1 Introduction  Mobile agents are a promising technology for the design and development of cooperative applications on the Internet [3, 5, 12, 13]. Due to their capability of autonomously roaming the Internet, mobile agents can move locally to the resources they need -- let them be users, data, or services -- and there interact with them. This can p...
