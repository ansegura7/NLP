The DC-tree: A Fully Dynamic Index Structure for Data Warehouses :  Many companies have recognized the strategic importance of the knowledge hidden in their large databases and have built data warehouses. Typically, updates are collected and applied to the data warehouse periodically in a batch mode, e.g., over night. Then, all derived information such as index structures has to be updated as well. The standard approach of bulk incremental updates to data warehouses has some drawbacks.First, the average runtime for a single update is small but the total runtime for the whole batch of updates may become rather large. Second, the contents of the data warehouse is not always up to date. In this paper, we introduced the DC-tree, a fully dynamic index structure for data warehouses modeled as a data cube. This new index structure is designed for applications where the above drawbacks of the bulk update approach are critical. The DC-tree is a hierarchical index structure - similar to the X-tree - exploiting the concept hierarchies typically defined for the...
