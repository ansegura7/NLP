Optimizing Information Agents by Selectively Materializing Data We present an approach for optimizing the performance  of information agents by materializing useful information  . A critical problem with information agents, particularly  those gathering and integrating information  from Web sources is a high query response time. This  is because the data needed to answer user queries is  present across several differentWeb sources (and in  several pages within a source) and retrieving,extracting  and integrating the data is time consuming. Weaddress  this problem by materializing useful classes of information  and defining them as auxiliary data sources  for the information agent. The key challenge here is to  identify the contentandschema of the classes of information  that would be useful to materialize. We present  an algorithm that identifies such classes by analyzing  patterns in user queries. We describe an implementation  of our approach and experiments in progress. We  also discuss other important problems that we will address  in optimizing information agents.
