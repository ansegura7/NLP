Ant Colony Optimisation for Virtual-Wavelength-Path Routing and Wavelength Allocation Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) is applied to the problem of routing and wavelength-allocation in a multi-wavelength all-optical virtual-wavelength-path routed transport network. Three variants of our ACO algorithm are proposed: local update (LU), global update/ distance (GU/D) and global update/occupancy (GU/O). All three extend the usual practice that ants are attracted by the pheromone trail of ants from their own colony: in our work, the artificial ants are also repelled by the pheromone of other colonies. Overall, the best ACO variant, GU/O, provides results that approach those of an earlier problem-specific heuristic on small- and medium-sized networks.  1 Introduction  Multi-wavelength all-optical transport networks have attracted considerable interest in recent years, because of their potential, by using multiple wavelengths in both optical transmission and optical switching, to provide the huge bandwidths necessary if broadband services are to be widely adopted [1]. In addition,...
