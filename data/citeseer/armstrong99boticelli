Boticelli: A Single-Camera Mobile Robot Using New Approaches to Range Data Fusion, World Modeling, and Navigation Planning ID: A083  Abstract  Boticelli is a mobile robot, designed and built for testing new approaches in stereo vision, world modeling, data fusion, map extraction, reinforcement learning and navigation planning. A single camera is used to capture depth information by taking advantage of camera movements. The main thrust of the new approaches is to replace well-known techniques, that depend upon grids of points in space with techniques that use continuous, piecewise linear functions. These techniques scale well to large, complex environments.
