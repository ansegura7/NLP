Building Behaviors Developmentally: A New Formalism This paper advocates a developmental approach to building complex interactive behaviors for robotic systems. A developmental methodology is advantageous because it provides a structured decomposition of complex tasks, because it facilitates learning, and because it allows for a gradual increase in task complexity. The developmental approach provides a structured means both of dividing a task among research units, as well as a metric for evaluating the progress of the task. Initial work with developmental modeling has also hinted that these skill decompositions may make the overall task easier to accomplish through the re-use of knowledge gained from developmental precursors. We report here on two projects of building behaviors developmentally for a humanoid robot. In the first project, the robot learned to reach to a visual target by following a developmental progression similar to those observed in infants. The second project outlines a proposal for building social skills developmenta...
