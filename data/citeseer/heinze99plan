Plan Recognition in Military Simulation: Incorporating Machine Learning with Intelligent Agents A view of plan recognition shaped by both  operational and computational requirements is  presented. Operational requirements governing  the level of fidelity and nature of the reasoning  process combine with computational requirements  including performance speed and software  engineering effort to constrain the types  of solutions available to the software developer.  By adopting machine learning to provide  spatio-temporal recognition of environmental  events and relationships, an agent can be provided  with a mechanism for mental state recognition  qualitatively different from previous research.  An architecture for integrating machine  learning into a BDI agent is suggested and the  results from the development of a prototype  provide proof-of-concept.  1 Introduction  This paper proposes machine-learning as a tool to assist in the construction of agents capable of plan recognition. This paper focuses on the beliefs-desires-intentions (BDI) class of agents. These agents have been ...
