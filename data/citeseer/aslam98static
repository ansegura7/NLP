Static and Dynamic Information Organization with Star Clusters In this paper we present a system for static and dynamic information organization and show our evaluations of this system on TREC data. We introduce the off-line and on-line star clustering algorithms for information organization. Our evaluation experiments show that the off-line star algorithm outperforms the single link and average link clustering algorithms. Since the star algorithm is also highly efficient and simple to implement, we advocate its use for tasks that require clustering, such as information organization, browsing, filtering, routing, topic tracking, and new topic detection.
