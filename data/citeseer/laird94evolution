The Evolution of the Soar Cognitive Architecture The origins of the Soar architecture can be traced back to the seminal research of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon on symbol systems, heuristic search, goals, problem spaces, and production systems. Since its official inception in 1982, Soar has evolved through six major releases, as both an AI architecture and as the basis for a unified theory of cognition. This paper traces this evolutionary path, starting with Soar's intellectual roots, and then proceeding through the stages defined by the six major system releases. Each stage is characterized with respect to a hierarchy of four levels of analysis: the knowledge level, the problem space level, the symbolic architecture level, and the implementation level.
