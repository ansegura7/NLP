Web Log Data Warehousing and Mining for Intelligent Web Caching We introduce intelligent web caching algorithms that employ predictive models of web requests; the general idea is to extend the LRU policy of web and proxy servers by making it sensible to web access models extracted from web log data using data mining techniques. Two approaches have been studied in particular, frequent patterns and decision trees. The experimental results of the new algorithms show substantial improvement over existing LRU-based caching techniques, in terms of hit rate. We designed and developed a prototypical system, which supports data warehousing of web log data, extraction of data mining models and simulation of the web caching algorithms.
