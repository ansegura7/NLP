Automatic Construction of Intelligent Diagrammatic Environments Introduction  Graphical user interfaces have become an integral part of almost every modern application type and it can be claimed that they are among the driving forces that have made the computer accessible to non-expert users. However, comparing the use of graphics in existent user interfaces with that in non-computer-based work, the inadequacy of standard GUIs for complex visual communication is revealed: Most GUIs are still WIMP interfaces centered around such simple interaction devices like icons, buttons, menus or image maps. On the contrary, in non-computerbased work rich and highly structured graphical notations prevail. There are diagrammatic languages in almost every technical discipline, for example circuit diagrams, architectural floor plans or chemical formulas, and modern software engineering is embracing all kinds of diagrammatic specification methods. Likewise, non-technical fields use their own well-established diagrammatic systems, for example choreography no
