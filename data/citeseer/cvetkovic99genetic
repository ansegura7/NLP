Genetic Algorithms Based Systems For Conceptual Engineering Design this paper we try to integrate methods of preferences and scenarios with Genetic Algorithms used to perform multi--objective optimisation. The goal is to make a system that will be able to work together with the designer during the conceptual design phase, where interaction and designer knowledge are sometimes more important than accuracy.
