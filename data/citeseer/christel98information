Information Visualization within a Digital Video Library . The Informedia Digital Video Library contains over a thousand hours of video, consuming over a terabyte of disk space. This paper summarizes the multimedia abstractions used to represent this video in prior systems and introduces the visualization techniques employed to browse and navigate multiple video documents at once.  Keywords: digital video library, information visualization, multimedia abstraction  1. Introduction  The Informedia Project at Carnegie Mellon University deals primarily with video.
