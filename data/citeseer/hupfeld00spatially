Spatially aware local communication in the RAUM system In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for local communication between devices in Ubiquitous Computing environments, assuming a multitude of computerized everyday appliances communicating with each other to solve tasks. This paradigm is based on the concept that the location of devices is central for the communication in such a scenario. Devices define their communication scope by spatial criteria. In our paradigm no explicit addressing or identification of communication partners is used. In comparison to traditional communication methods the approach eases routing and discovery problems and can be deployed in a highly dynamic environment without centralized services. We use the term local communication as inter-device communication in a physically restricted local area. This is well distinguish from the terms telecommunication as communication over distance where location information is explicitly hidden. The communication model (RAUM) introduced is based on the observ...
