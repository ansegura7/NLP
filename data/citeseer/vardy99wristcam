The WristCam as Input Device We show how images of a user's hand from a video camera attached to the underside of the wrist can be processed to yield finger movement information. Discrete (and discreet) movements of the fingers away from a rest position are translated into a small set of base symbols. These are interpreted as input to a wearable computer, providing unobtrusive control.
