Logical Update Queries as Open Nested Transactions . The rule-based update language ULTRA has been designed for the  specification of complex database updates in a modular fashion. The logical semantics  of update goals is based on update request sets, which correspond to  deferred basic updates in the database. The declarative character of the logical  semantics leaves much freedom for various evaluation strategies, among them  a top-down resolution, which can be naturally mapped onto a system of nested  transactions. In this paper, we extend this operational model as follows: Not only  the basic operations are performed and committed independently from the toplevel  transaction, but also complex operations defined by update rules. This leads  to an open nested transaction hierarchy, which allows to exploit the semantical  properties of complex operations to gain more concurrency. On the other hand,  high-level compensation is necessary and meta information must be provided by  the programmer. We present the key elements of this combi...
