Extensible and Similarity-based Grouping for Data Integration Data integration as required in a variety of applications like data warehousing, information system  integration etc. makes great demands regarding features to deal with overlapping and inconsistent  data. Object-relational and other data management systems available today provide only limited concepts  to deal with these requirements. The general concept of grouping and aggregation appears to  be a fitting paradigm for various of the current issues in data integration, but in its common form of  equality-based grouping a number of problems remain unsolved. Various extensions to this concept  have been introduced over the last years regarding user-defined functions for aggregation and grouping.
