A Replicable Web-Based Negotiation Server For E-Commerce This paper describes our ongoing R&D effort in developing a replicable, Web-based negotiation server to conduct bargaining-type negotiations between clients (i.e., buyers and sellers) in e-commerce. Multiple copies of this server can be paired with existing Web-servers to provide negotiation capabilities. Each client can select a trusted negotiation server to represent his/her interests. Web-based GUI tools are used by clients in a build-time registration process to specify the requirements, constraints, negotiation strategic rules, and preference scoring methods related to the buying or selling of a product. The registration information is used by the negotiation servers to conduct negotiations automatically on behalf of the clients. In this paper, we present the architecture of the negotiation server and the framework for automated negotiations, and describe a number of communication primitives, which make up the negotiation protocol. We have developed a constraint satisfaction processor (CSP) to evaluate a negotiation proposal against the registered constraints. An Event-Trigger-Rule (ETR) server manages events and triggers the execution of strategic rules, which may relax constraints, notify clients, or perform other operations. Strategic rules can be added and modified at run-time to deal with the dynamic nature of negotiations. A cost-benefit analysis performs quantitative analysis of alternative negotiation conditions. We have implemented a prototype system to demonstrate automated negotiations among buyers and suppliers in a supply chain management system.
