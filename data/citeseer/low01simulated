Simulated 3D Painting This technical report looks at the motivation for simulating painting directly on 3D objects, and investigates the main issues faced by such systems. These issues include the provision of natural user interfaces, the reproduction of realistic brush effects and the surface parameterization for texture mapping so that the results of the painting can be stored on texture maps. The technical report further investigates the issues involved in using a haptic interface for simulating 3D painting, and the issues in surface parameterization for texture mapping with application to 3D painting. A survey of some work related to 3D painting, haptic rendering and surface parameterization for texture mapping is presented.  1
