Rule Discovery From Time Series We consider the problem of finding rules relating patterns  in a time series to other patterns in that series,  or patterns in one series to patterns in another series.  A simple example is a rule such as "a period  of low telephone call activity is usually followed by a  sharp rise in call volume". Examples of rules relating  two or more time series are "if the Microsoft stock  price goes up and Intel falls, then IBM goes up the  next day," and "if Microsoft goes up strongly for one  day, then declines strongly on the next day, and on  the same days Intel stays about level, then IBM stays  about level." Our emphasis is in the discovery of local  patterns in multivariate time series, in contrast to traditional  time series analysis which largely focuses on  global models. Thus, we search for rules whose conditions  refer to patterns in time series. However, we do  not want to define beforehand which patterns are to be  used; rather, we want the patterns to be formed from  the data in t...
