TypTex: Inductive typological text classification by multivariate statistical analysis for NLP systems tuning/evaluation The increasing use of methods in natural language processing (NLP) which are based on huge corpora require that the lexical, morphosyntactic and syntactic homogeneity of texts be mastered. We have developed a methodology and associate tools for text calibration or "profiling" within the ELRA benchmark called "Contribution to the construction of contemporary french corpora" based on multivariate analysis of linguistic features. We have integrated these tools within a modular architecture based on a generic model allowing us on the one hand flexible annotation of the corpus with the output of NLP and statistical tools and on the other hand retracing the results of these tools through the annotation layers back to the primary textual data. This allows us to justify our interpretations.  1. Introduction  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is increasingly dependent on corpus-based methods. The availability of corpora is no longer a problem, as huge and annotated corpora are now readily avail...
