Hierarchical Presentation of Expansion Terms Different presentations of candidate expansion terms have not been fully explored in interactive query expansion (IQE). Most existing systems that offer an IQE facility use a list form of presentation. This paper examines an hierarchical presentation of the expansion terms which are automatically generated from a set of retrieved documents, organised in a general to specific manner, and visualised by cascade menus. To evaluate the effectiveness of the presentation, a user test was carried out to compare the hierarchical form with the conventional list form. This shows that users of the hierarchy can complete the expansion task in less time and with fewer terms over those using the lists. Relations between initial query terms and selected expansion terms were also investigated.  Keywords  Information retrieval, interactive query expansion, concept hierarchies 1.
