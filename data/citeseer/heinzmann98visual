A Visual Interface for Human-Robot Interaction This paper describes the architecture of a human-robot interaction system and recent work on the vision based human-robot interface. The aim of the project is to develop a robotic system that is safely able to work with a human operator. This means in particular that the operator should be allowed into the work space of the robot and even to interact with the robot by direct contact with the manipulator. Safety issues are of major importance here, so open loop force control and backdrivability of the manipulator are mandatory features of the system. The human-robot interface is visionbased to achieve a natural interaction between the operator and the robot. Important aspects of this interaction are the ability of the vision system to find and track the operators face, to recognise facial gestures and to determine the users gaze point. These functions are implemented in a robust way so tracking failures can be compensated for and temporary occlusions of the face are tolerated. 1 Introdu...
