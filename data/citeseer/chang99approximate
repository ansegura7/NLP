Approximate Query Translation across Heterogeneous Information Sources In this paper we present a mechanism for  approximately translating Boolean query constraints  across heterogeneous information sources.  Achieving the best translation is challenging because  sources support different constraints for formulating  queries, and often these constraints cannot  be precisely translated. For instance, a query  [score ? 8] might be "perfectly" translated as  [rating ? 0.8] at some site, but can only be approximated  as [grade = A] at another. Unlike  other work, our general framework adopts a customizable  "closeness" metric for the translation  that combines both precision and recall. Our results  show that for query translation we need to  handle interdependencies among both query conjuncts  as well as disjuncts. As the basis, we identify  the essential requirements of a rule system for  users to encode the mappings for atomic semantic  units. Our algorithm then translates complex  queries by rewriting them in terms of the semantic  units. We show that, un...
