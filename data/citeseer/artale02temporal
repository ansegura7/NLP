A Temporal Description Logic for Reasoning over Conceptual Schemas and Queries This paper introduces a new logical formalism, intended for temporal conceptual modelling,  as a natural combination of the well-known description logic DLR and point-based linear  temporal logic with Since and Until. The expressive power of the resulting DLRUS logic is illustrated  by providing a characterisation of the most important temporal conceptual modelling  constructs appeared in the literature. We define a query language (where queries are non-recursive  Datalog programs and atoms are complex DLRUS expressions) and investigate the problem of  checking query containment under the constraints defined by DLRUS conceptual schemas---i.e.,  DLRUS knowledge bases---as well as the problems of schema satisfiability and logical implication.
