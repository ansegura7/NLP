Enterprise Agents Solving Conflicts: The cobac Approach . Autonomous agents seem to be a  promising approach for application in computermediated  supply webs. Supporting the management and  integration of the planning, scheduling, and controlling  processes they can be used as "enterprise delegates".  However, this leads to a problem with common  autonomous agent architectures, as they are not  designed to model complex decision behavior of entire  companies.  In this paper we present an innovative approach to  model Intelligent Agents in the context of the new agent  architecture "Enterprise Agents", which is using  conflicts of interests explicitly to determine agent's  behavior and discuss its application to eBusiness.
