Active User Interfaces For Building Decision-Theoretic Systems Knowledge elicitation/acquisition continues to be a bottleneck to constructing decisiontheoretic  systems. Methodologies and techniques for incremental elicitation/acquisition of  knowledge especially under uncertainty in support of users' current goals is desirable. This  paper presents PESKI, a probabilistic expert system development environment. PESKI provides  users with a highly interactive and integrated suite of intelligent knowledge engineering  tools for decision-theoretic systems. From knowledge acquisition, data mining, and verification  and validation to a distributed inference engine for querying knowledge, PESKI is based  on the concept of active user interfaces -- actuators to the human-machine interface. PESKI  uses a number of techniques to reduce the inherent complexity of developing a cohesive, realworld  knowledge-based system. This is accomplished by providing multiple communication  modes for human-computer interaction and the use of a knowledge representation endowed  with the ability to detect problems with the knowledge acquired and alert the user to these  possible problems. We discuss PESKI's use of these intelligent assistants to help users with  the acquisition of knowledge especially in the presence of uncertainty.
