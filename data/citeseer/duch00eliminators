Eliminators and Classifiers Classification may not be reliable for several reasons: noise in the data, insufficient input information, overlapping distributions and sharp definition of classes. Faced with K possibilities a decision support system may still be useful in such cases if instead of classification elimination of improbable classes is done. Eliminators may be constructed using classifiers assigning new cases to a pool of several classes instead of just one winning class. Elimination may be done with the help of several classifiers using modified error functions. A real life medical example is presented illustrating the usefulness of elimination.
