Less is More: Active Learning with Support Vector Machines We describe a simple active learning heuristic  which greatly enhances the generalization behavior  of support vector machines (SVMs) on several  practical document classification tasks. We  observe a number of benefits, the most surprising  of which is that a SVM trained on a wellchosen  subset of the available corpus frequently  performs better than one trained on all available  data. The heuristic for choosing this subset is  simple to compute, and makes no use of information  about the test set. Given that the training  time of SVMs depends heavily on the training  set size, our heuristic not only offers better performance  with fewer data, it frequently does so  in less time than the naive approach of training  on all available data.  1. Introduction  There are many uses for a good document classifier --- sorting mail into mailboxes, filtering spam or routing news articles. The problem is that learning to classify documents requires manually labelling more documents than a typical...
