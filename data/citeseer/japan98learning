Learning to Perceive the World as Articulated: An Approach for Hierarchical Learning in Sensory-Motor Systems This paper describes how agents can learn an internal model of the world  structurally by focusing on the problem of behavior-based articulation. We develop  an on-line learning scheme -- the so-called mixture of recurrent neural  net (RNN) experts -- in which a set of RNN modules becomes self-organized  as experts on multiple levels in order to account for the different categories  of sensory-motor flow which the robot experiences. Autonomous switching of  activated modules in the lower level actually represents the articulation of the  sensory-motor flow. In the meanwhile, a set of RNNs in the higher level competes  to learn the sequences of module switching in the lower level, by which articulation  at a further more abstract level can be achieved. The proposed scheme  was examined through simulation experiments involving the navigation learning  problem. Our dynamical systems analysis clarified the mechanism of the articulation;  the possible correspondence between the articulation...
