Providing Integrated Toolkit-Level Support for Ambiguity in Recognition-Based Interfaces Recognition technologies are being used extensively in both the commercial and research worlds. But recognizers are still error-prone, and this results in performance problems and brittle dialogues. These problems are a barrier to acceptance and usefulness of recognition systems. Better interfaces to recognition systems, which can help to reduce the burden of recognition errors, are difficult to build because of lack of knowledge about the ambiguity inherent in recognition. We have extended a user interface toolkit in order to model and to provide structured support for ambiguity at the input event level [7]. This makes it possible to build re-usable interface components for resolving ambiguity and dealing with recognition errors. These interfaces can help to reduce the negative effects of recognition errors. By providing these components at a toolkit level, we make it easier for application writers to provide good support for error handling. And we can explore new types of interfaces for resolving a more varied range of ambiguity.
