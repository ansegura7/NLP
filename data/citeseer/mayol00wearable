Wearable Visual Robots This paper presents a wearable active visual sensor which is able to achieve a level of decoupling of camera movement from the wearer???s posture and movements. This decoupling is the result of a combination of an active sensing approach, inertial information and visual sensor feedback. The issues of sensor placement, robot kinematics and their relation to wearability are discussed. The performance of the prototype head is evaluated for some essential visual tasks. The paper also discusses potential application scenarios for this kind of wearable robot. 1
