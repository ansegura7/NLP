Trajectory Guided Tracking and Recognition of Actions A combined 2D, 3D approach is presented that allows for robust tracking of moving people and  recognition of actions. It is assumed that the system observes multiple moving objects via a single,  uncalibrated video camera. Low-level features are often insufficient for detection, segmentation, and  tracking of non-rigid moving objects. Therefore, an improved mechanism is proposed that integrates  low-level (image processing), mid-level (recursive 3D trajectory estimation), and high-level (action  recognition) processes. A novel extended Kalman filter formulation is used in estimating the relative  3D motion trajectories up to a scale factor. The recursive estimation process provides a prediction  and error measure that is exploited in higher-level stages of action recognition. Conversely, higherlevel  mechanisms provide feedback that allows the system to reliably segment and maintain the  tracking of moving objects before, during, and after occlusion. The 3D trajectory, occlusion, and  segmentation information are utilized in extracting stabilized views of the moving object that are then  used as input to action recognition modules. Trajectory-guided recognition (TGR) is proposed as a  new and efficient method for adaptive classification of action. The TGR approach is demonstrated  using "motion history images" that are then recognized via a mixture-of-Gaussians classifier. The  system was tested in recognizing various dynamic human outdoor activities: running, walking, roller  blading, and cycling. Experiments with real and synthetic data sets are used to evaluate stability of  the trajectory estimator with respect to noise.
