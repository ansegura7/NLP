In many applications, information about the past and future is just as important as information about the present. Incorporating the time dimension into existing database theory and practice is interesting and important. Temporal databases extend classical #snapshot" databases by supporting the storage and the access of time-related information. When history is taken into account, integrity constraints can place restrictions on the evolution of data in time. This paper deals with extending dependency theory for temporal databases with complex objects.  In general, classical dependencies can be applied to temporal databases in a straightforward manner. From an abstr...
