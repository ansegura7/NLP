Control and Datatypes using the View Formalism . We herein deal with mixed specification formalisms, i.e. formalisms with both a static (data types) and a dynamic (behaviour) part. Our formalism is based on symbolic transition systems (STS) [9], that allow one to specify systems at an abstract level and to avoid state explosion. STS are a kind of guarded finite state/transition diagrams where states and transitions are labelled with open terms. Both dynamic and static parts of objects are specified, in a unifying approach, as formal structures that we call views. These components interpretation structures use STS, and we show how these may be derived from their view structures. The system is structured by means of collections of objects (with identities) . A temporal logic is used to glue the components altogether and expresses a generalized form of synchronous product [1]. We then show how a view structure and its interpretation structure may be obtained. The formalism is explained using a simplified phone service example.  Keywor...
