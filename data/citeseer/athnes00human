Human factors in ATC alarms and notifications design: an experimental evaluation With the growing use of computerised working position, alarm design on air traffic control displays is a concern as events to be notified increase in number and diversity. Safety requires visual notifications that can be efficiently detected and understood. It also requires that no information on the radar display is obscured by the visual notifications. We also need to design hierarchies of notifications, from most severe to benign. Taking advantage of the current graphical capabilities of computers, we have identified and explored various dimensions in visual alarm design. We present in this paper an experimental evaluation, in terms of detection time and precision, of several of those dimensions: opacity, size, temporal profile of animation and signal frequency. From our results, we conclude that opacity, size and temporal profile of animation are well suited to introduce some nuances in the way we convey notifications on visual displays. We also show that detection of a given signa...
