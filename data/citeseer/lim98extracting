Extracting Structures of HTML Documents Using a High-Level Stack Machine Information on the Web, which are conglomeration of heterogeneous data such as texts, images and audio clips, are often accessed through documents written according to the HTML specification [7]. According to the HTML specification, HTML documents are semistructured in nature. We propose a high-level stack machine (HSM) which accesses an HTML document through its URL and constructs a semistructured data graph (SDG) of the document. The SDG of an HTML document H precisely captures the structure of the semistructured data embedded in H based on the dependency relationship [11] among the data objects in H . HSM is configurable to accommodate a user's interest with respect to the HTML elements in H to be considered during the construction process of the SDG of H .  1 Introduction  During the early days of the World-Wide Web (WWW or Web), users heavily relied on the mouse-button-click navigation method through hyperlinks provided by Web browsers to retrieve information of interest and soon ...
