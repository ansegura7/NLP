Types of Incremental Learning This paper is intended to introduce a closer  look at incremental learning by developing the  two concepts of informationally incremental  learning and operationally incremental learning.  These concept are applied to the problem  of learning containment decision lists for  demonstrating its relevance.  1 Introduction  The intention of the present paper is to introduce two new notions in incremental learning which allow a classification of phenomena finer than known so far in the area. These concepts are denoted by the phrases informationally incremental learning and operationally incremental learning, respectively. Roughly spoken, informationally incremental algorithms are required to work incrementally as usual, i.e. they have no permission to look back at the whole history of information presented during the learning process. Operationally incremental learning algorithms may have permission to look back, but they are not allowed to use information of the past in some effective way. ...
