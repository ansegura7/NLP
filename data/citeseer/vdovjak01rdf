RDF Based Architecture for Semantic Integration of Heterogeneous Information Sources . The proposed integration architecture aims at exploiting data semantics in order to provide a coherent and meaningful (with respect to a given conceptual model) view of the integrated heterogeneous information sources. The architecture is split into five separate layers to assure modularization, providing description, requirements, and interfaces for each. It favors the lazy retrieval paradigm over the data warehousing approach. The novelty of the architecture lies in the combination of semantic and on-demand driven retrieval. This line of attack offers several advantages but brings also challenges, both of which we discuss with respect to RDF, the architecture's underlying model. 1 Introduction, Background, and Related Work  With the vast expansion of the World Wide Web during the last few years the integration of heterogeneous information sources has become a hot topic. A solution to this integration problem allows for the design of applications that provide a uniform access to dat...
