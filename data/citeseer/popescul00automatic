Automatic Labeling of Document Clusters Automatically labeling document clusters with words which indicate their topics is difficult to do well. The most commonly used method, labeling with the most frequent words in the clusters, ends up using many words that are virtually void of descriptive power even after traditional stop words are removed. Another method, labeling with the most predictive words, often includes rather obscure words. We present two methods of labeling document clusters motivated by the model that words are generated by a hierarchy of mixture components of varying generality. The first method assumes existence of a document hierarchy (manually constructed or resulting from a hierarchical clustering algorithm) and uses a 2 test of significance to detect different word usage across categories in the hierarchy. The second method selects words which both occur frequently in a cluster and effectively discriminate the given cluster from the other clusters. We compare these methods on abstracts of documents sel...
