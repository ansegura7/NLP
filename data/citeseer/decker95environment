Environment Centered Analysis and Design of Coordination Mechanisms Environment Centered Analysis and Design of Coordination Mechanisms  May 1995 KEITH S. DECKER B.S., Carnegie Mellon University M.S., Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Ph.D., University of Massachusetts Amherst Directed by: Professor Victor R. Lesser Committee: Professor Paul R. Cohen Professor John A. Stankovic Professor Douglas L. Anderton Coordination, as the act of managing interdependencies between activities, is one of the central research issues in Distributed Artificial Intelligence. Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organization or coordination mechanism for all environments. Problems in coordinating the activities of distributed intelligent agents appear in many domains: the control of distributed sensor networks; multi-agent scheduling of people and/or machines; distributed diagnosis of errors in local-area or telephone networks; concurrent engineering; `software agents' for information gathering. The design of coordination mechanisms for groups of compu...
