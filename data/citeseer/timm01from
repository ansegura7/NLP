From Corporate Memories to Supply Web Memory Modern production has discovered knowledge as  an additional factor of production and a new trend  of research, development and implementation of  corporate memory systems is arising. The global  economy leads to tighter corporation relations between  enterprises. Therefore the knowledge of one  product does not exist in a single company but  within participating companies respective the supply  chain. A modern product centered knowledge  management has to face the difficult task of the integration  of distributed knowledge sources.  This contribution states our interest in research on  the integration of corporate memory. In a first step  we are focusing on single products leading to supply  chain memories. Further research and development  will lead to supply web memory.  1
