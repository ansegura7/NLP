Representing School Timetabling in a Disjunctive Logic Programming Language In this paper, we show how school timetabling problems with preferences originating from didactical, organisational and personal considerations can be represented in a highly declarative and natural way, using an extension of disjunctive datalog by strong and weak (integrity) constraints. 1 Introduction  Almost all people have come across school timetabling during their lives. For a long time almost all school timetables were created manually, a timeconsuming task, which often yielded suboptimal schedules. In the last thirty years, however, systems have been designed which automate timetable creation.  Timetabling in general is the problem of finding suitable combinations of two or more types of resources which have to be at the same place during several discrete periods of time and which have to satisfy various additional constraints. Some of these constraints are strict while some are not (the latter express preferences or desiderata). In the case of school timetabling problems these...
