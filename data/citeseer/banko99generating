Generating Extraction-Based Summaries from Hand-Written Summaries by Aligning Text Spans Human-quality text summarization systems based on sentence extraction are difficult to design because documents can differ along several dimensions, such as length, writing style and lexical usage. The lack of suitable corpora of extraction-based summaries makes it difficult to evaluate and improve existing algorithms. However, there are a large number of hand-written (not extraction-based) summaries available for news-wire stories. This paper discusses our work on generating a corpus of approximately 25,000 extractionbased summaries from hand-written summaries. We discuss how text-span alignment can be applied to this problem and how this problem differs from previous work on aligning parallel texts. In addition, we briefly analyze differences between handwritten and extracted summaries. 1 Introduction  Human-quality text summarization systems based on sentence extraction are difficult to design, and even more difficult to evaluate, because documents can differ along several dimension...
