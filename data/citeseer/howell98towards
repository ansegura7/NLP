Towards Visually Mediated Interaction using Appearance-Based Models . This paper reports initial research on supporting Visually Mediated Interaction  (VMI) by developing generic expression models and person-specific and  generic gesture models for the control of active cameras. We investigate the recognition  of both head pose and expression using simple generalisation of trained  generic models using Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. Then we go on  to describe a time-delay variant (TDRBF) of the network and evaluate its performance  on recognising simple pointing and waving hand gestures in image sequences.  Experimental results are presented that show that high levels of performance  in gesture recognition can be obtained using these techniques, both for  particular individuals and across a set of individuals. Characteristic visual evidence  can be automatically selected and used even to recognise individuals from their  gestures, depending on the task demands.  1 Introduction  This paper reports initial research on supporting Visually Mediated ...
