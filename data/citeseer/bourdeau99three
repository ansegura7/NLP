Three Dimensional Optimization of Supersonic Inlets This paper presents the implementation of these new design techniques and their application to a Mach 3 inlet case. The significant improvements obtained using two different optimizers are presented and compared. The results of these optimizations have been verified using a full Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes solver. All the following results are thoroughly analysed and placed into an industrial context. 1 Introduction
