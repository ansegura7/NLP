Context and Page Analysis for Improved Web Search NEC Research Institute has developed a metasearch engine that improves the efficiency of Web searches by downloading and analyzing each document and then displaying results that show the query terms in context. Several popular and useful search engines such as AltaVista, Excite, HotBot, Infoseek, Lycos, and Northern Light attempt to maintain full-text indexes of the World Wide Web. However, relying on a single standard search engine has limitations. The standard search engines have limited coverage, 1,2 outdated databases, and are sometimes unavailable due to problems with the network or the engine itself. The precision of standard engine results can also vary because they generally focus on handling queries quickly and use relatively simple ranking schemes. 3 Rankings can be further muddled by keyword spamming to increase a page's rank order. Often, the relevance of a particular page is obvious only after loading it and finding the query terms. Metasearch engines, such as MetaCrawler and SavvySearch, attempt to contend with the problem of limited coverage by submitting queries to several standard search engines at once. 4,5 The primary advantages of metasearch engines are that they combine the results of several search engines and present a consistent user interface. 5 However, most metasearch engines rely on the documents and summaries returned by standard search engines and so inherit their limited precision and vulnerability to keyword spamming. We developed the NEC Research Institute (NECI) metasearch engine [now called Inquirus] to improve the efficiency and precision of Web search by downloading and analyzing each document and then displaying results that show the query terms in
