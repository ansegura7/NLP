Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning In this paper we investigate the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning to speed up the acquisition of cooperative multi-agent tasks. We extend the MAXQ framework to the multi-agent case. Each agent uses the same MAXQ hierarchy to decompose a task into sub-tasks. Learning is decentralized, with each agent learning three interrelated skills: how to perform subtasks, which order to do them in, and how to coordinate with other agents. Coordination skills among agents are learned by using joint actions at the highest level(s) of the hierarchy. The Q nodes at the highest level(s) of the hierarchy are configured to represent the joint task-action space among multiple agents. In this approach, each agent only knows what other agents are doing at the level of sub-tasks, and is unaware of lower level (primitive) actions. This hierarchical approach allows agents to learn coordination faster by sharing information at the level of sub-tasks, rather than attempting to learn coordination taking into account primitive joint state-action values. We apply this hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to a complex AGV scheduling task and compare its performance and speed with other learning approaches, including at multi-agent, single agent using MAXQ, selfish multiple agents using MAXQ (where each agent acts independently without communicating with the other agents), as well as several well-known AGV heuristics like "first come first serve", "highest queue first" and "nearest station first". We also compare the tradeoffs in learning speed vs. performance of modeling joint action values at multiple levels in the MAXQ hierarchy.
