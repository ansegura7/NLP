Advanced Interaction in Context . Mobile information appliances are increasingly used in numerous  different situations and locations, setting new requirements to their interaction  methods. When the user's situation, place or activity changes, the functionality  of the device should adapt to these changes. In this work we propose a layered  real-time architecture for this kind of context-aware adaptation based on  redundant collections of low-level sensors. Two kinds of sensors are  distinguished: physical and logical sensors, which give cues from environment  parameters and host information. A prototype board that consists of eight  sensors was built for experimentation. The contexts are derived from cues using  real-time recognition software, which was constructed after experiments with  Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps and its variants. A personal digital assistant  (PDA) and a mobile phone were used with the prototype to demonstrate  situational awareness. On the PDA font size and backlight were changed  depending...
