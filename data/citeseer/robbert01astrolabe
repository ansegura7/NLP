Astrolabe: A Robust and Scalable Technology for Distributed System Monitoring, Management, and Data Mining this paper, we describe a new information management service called Astrolabe. Astrolabe monitors the dynamically changing state of a collection of distributed resources, reporting summaries of this information to its users. Like DNS, Astrolabe organizes the resources into a hierarchy of domains, which we call zones to avoid confusion, and associates attributes with each zone. Unlike DNS, zones are not bound to specific servers, the attributes may be highly dynamic, and updates propagate quickly; typically, in tens of seconds
