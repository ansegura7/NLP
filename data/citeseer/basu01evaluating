Evaluating the Novelty of Text-Mined Rules Using Lexical Knowledge A data-mining system may discover a large body of rules; however, relatively few of these may convey useful new knowledge to the user. Several metrics for evaluating the "interestingness" of mined rules have been proposed. However, most of these measure simplicity (e.g. rule size), certainty (e.g. confidence), or utility (e.g. support). Another important aspect of interestingness is novelty: does the rule represent an association that is currently unknown. In this paper, we present a new method of estimating the novelty of rules discovered by data-mining methods using WordNet, a lexical knowledge-base of English words. We have shown that novelty of a rule can be assessed by the average semantic distance in a knowledge hierarchy between the words in the antecedent and the consequent of the rule - the more the average distance, more is the novelty of the rule. We present an experimental evaluation of this novelty metric by applying it to rules mined from book descriptions extracted from A...
