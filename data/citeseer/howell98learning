Learning Gestures for Visually Mediated Interaction This paper reports initial research on supporting Visually Mediated Interaction  (VMI) by developing person-specific and generic gesture models  for the control of active cameras. We describe a time-delay variant of the  Radial Basis Function (TDRBF) network and evaluate its performance on  recognising simple pointing and waving hand gestures in image sequences.
