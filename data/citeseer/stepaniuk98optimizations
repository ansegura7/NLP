Optimizations of Rough Set Model . Rough set methodology is based on concept (set) approximations constructed  from available background knowledge represented in information systems [14]. In many  applications only partial knowledge about approximated concepts is given. Hence quite  often first a parametrized family of concept approximations is built and next by tuning of  the parameters the best, in a sense, approximation is chosen (see e.g. variable precision  rough set model [40]) in approximation spaces. In this paper we follow this approach in  generalized approximation spaces. We discuss rough set model based on approximation  spaces with uncertainty functions and rough inclusions. Both elements of approximation  space are parametrized and for the proper application of such model to a particular data set  it is necessary to make optimization of the parameters. We discuss basic properties of the  mentioned model and also strategies of parameters optimization. We also present different  notions of rough relations....
