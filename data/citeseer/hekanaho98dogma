DOGMA: A GA-Based Relational Learner We describe a GA-based concept learning/theory revision system DOGMA and discuss how it can be applied to relational learning. The search for better theories in DOGMA is guided by a novel fitness function that combines the minimal description length and information gain measures. To show the efficacy of the system we compare it to other learners in three relational domains. Keywords: Relational Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Minimal Description Length  1 Introduction  Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are stochastic general purpose search algorithms, that have been applied to a wide range of Machine Learning problems. They work by evolving a population of chromosomes, each of which encodes a potential solution to the problem at hand. The task of a GA is to find a highly fit chromosome through the application of different selection and perturbation operators. In this paper we consider the use of GAs in relational concept learning, i.e. in the process of learning and extracting relational classif...
