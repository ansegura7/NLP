Application of Moving Objects and Spatiotemporal Reasoning In order to predict future variations of moving objects which general attributes, locations, and regions of  spatial objects are changed over time, spatiotemporal data, domain knowledge, and spatiotemporal operations  are required to process together with temporal and spatial attributes of data. However, conventional researches  on temporal and spatial reasoning cannot be applied directly to the inference using moving objects, because they  have been studied separately on temporal or spatial attribute of data. Therefore, in this paper, we not only define  spatial objects in time domain but also propose a new type of moving objects and spatiotemporal reasoning  model that has the capability of operation and inference for moving objects. The proposed model is made up  of spatiotemporal database, GIS tool, and inference engine for application of spatiotemporal reasoning using  moving objects and they execute operations and inferences for moving objects. Finally, to show the applicability  of the proposed model, a proper domain is established for the battlefield analysis system to support commander's  decision making in the army operational situation and it is experimented with this domain.
