Representing Coordination Relationships with Influence Diagrams It is well know the necessity of managing relationships among agents  in a multi-agent system to achieve coordinated behavior. One approach to manage  such relationships consists of using an explicit representation of them, allowing  each agent to choose its actions based on them. Previous work in the area have  considered ideal situations, such as fully known environments, static relationships  and shared mental states. In this paper we propose to represent relationships  among agents and entities in a multi-agent system by using influence diagrams.
