Temporal Patterns (TRAPs) in ASR of Noisy Speech In this paper we study a new approach to processing temporal information for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Specifically, we study the use of rather longtime TempoRAl Patterns (TRAPs) of spectral energies in place of the conventional spectral patterns for ASR. The proposed Neural TRAPs are found to yield significant amount of complementary information to that of the conventional spectral feature based ASR system. A combination of these two ASR systems is shown to result in improved robustness to several types of additive and convolutive environmental degradations.  1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Spectral features  Spectrum-based techniques form the basis of most feature extraction methods in current ASR. A drawback of the spectral features is that they are quite sensitive to changes in the communication environment e.g. characteristics of different communication channels or environmental noise. Subsequently, recognizers based on spectral features exhibit rapid degradation in performance in ...
