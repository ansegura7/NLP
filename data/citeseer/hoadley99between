These two types of media map easily on to two types of social activities in which learning is grounded: dialogue and monologue. Drawing on literature in learning theory, we suggest the need for interfaces that helpstudents transition from dialogue to monologue and back again. This "middle space" between communication and information interfaces is illustrated with several examples from CSCL. We advocate filling in this middle space with software and activities that transcend some of the traditional design tradeoffs associated with information and communication interfaces. Keywords: Collaboration, Interaction & Design Tradeoffs Introduction: computers, communication & learning Computer mediated acts of communication are becoming more commonplace in today's classroom. Like all media, particular computer techn...
