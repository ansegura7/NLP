A Graph Query Language and Its Query Processing Many new database applications involve querying of graph data. In this paper, we present an objectoriented graph data model, and an OQL like graph query language, GOQL. The data model and the language are illustrated in the application domain of multimedia presentation graphs. We then discuss the query processing techniques for GOQL, more specifically, the translation of GOQL into an operatorbased language, called O-Algebra, extended with operators to deal with paths and sequences. We also discuss different approaches for efficient implementations of algebra operators for paths and sequences. 1 Introduction  Many database applications such as hypertext applications, geographic information systems, world wide web searching, and heterogeneous information integration, etc., require modeling and querying of graph data ([Guti94, GBPV 94, MeMM 96, BDHS 96, AQMWW 96, AM 98, FFKLS 98, LSBBOO98]). In this paper, we present a data model, and an OQL-like query language GOQL, for querying graphs. ...
