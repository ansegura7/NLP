Jinni: Intelligent Mobile Agent Programming at the Intersection of Java and Prolog . Jinni (Java INference engine and Networked Interactor), is a lightweight, multi-threaded, logic programming language, intended to be used as a flexible scripting tool for gluing together knowledge processing components and Java objects in distributed applications. Jinni threads are coordinated through blackboards, local to each process. Associative search based on term unification (a variant of Linda) is used as the basic synchronization mechanism. Threads are controlled with tiny interpreters following a scripting language based on a subset of Prolog. Mobile threads, implemented by capturing first order continuations in a compact data structure sent over the network, allow Jinni to interoperate with remote high performance BinProlog servers for CPU-intensive knowledge processing and with other Jinni components over the Internet. The synergy of these features makes Jinni a convenient development platform for distributed AI, and in particular, for building intelligent autonomous agent...
