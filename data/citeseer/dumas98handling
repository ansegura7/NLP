Handling Temporal Grouping and Pattern-Matching Queries in a Temporal Object Model This paper presents a language for expressing temporal pattern-matching queries, and a set of temporal grouping operators for structuring histories following calendar-based criteria. Pattern-matching queries are shown to be useful for reasoning about successive events in time while temporal grouping may be either used to aggregate data along the time dimension or to display histories. The combination of these capabilities allows to express complex queries involving succession in time and calendar-based conditions simultaneously. These operators are embedded into the TEMPOS temporal data model and their use is illustrated through examples taken from a geographical application. The proposal has been validated by a prototype on top of the O 2 DBMS.  Keywords: temporal databases, temporal object model, temporal query language, pattern-matching queries, temporal grouping, calendar, granularity, O 2 .  1 Introduction  In most modern DBMS, time is one of the primitive datatypes provided for d...
