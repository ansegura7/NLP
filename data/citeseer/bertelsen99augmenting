Augmenting reality in mobile substrates - On the design of computer support for process control The paper investigates augmented reality as a perspective on the design of computer support for process control in a distributed environment. Based on empirical studies of work in a wastewater treatment plant, three technical approaches on augmented reality --- augmenting the user; the object of work; and the environment --- are examined in terms of a collection of design scenarios .We conclude that these approaches when used, as metaphors rather than a consistent theoretical framework, may inform design of mobile support for process control work.  Keywords: Augmented reality, process control, mobile computing, human-computer interaction, participatory design, workplace studies.  BRT Keywords: AB, FA, FC, GA, HD Introduction  Advanced technical (process) settings, such as modern wastewater treatment plants, are characterised by being highly distributed and dynamic. A possible strategy for supporting work in such settings is through the introduction of mobile technology. In this paper, ...
