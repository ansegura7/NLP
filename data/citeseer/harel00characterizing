Characterizing A Media-Enhanced Classroom Server Media-enhanced classrooms are changing the way we teach and learn. Servers for such applications  differ from a typical web server in the nature and geographic spread of the user community and the type  of information accessed from the server. This paper compares the workload of the Classroom 2000 server,  a media-enhanced classroom server, with that of a typical web server. We find several similarities and  differences between the two workloads. One of the most striking differences is that the inter-reference times  for files accessed more than once from the Classroom 2000 server are not independent, as opposed to those  of a web server.  We show that the user interface presented by the Classroom 2000 server affects server workload. We  find that client-side caching improves over time. Finally, in addition to accessing lecture material for their  current courses, students also access archieved material from previous quarters.  1 Introduction  Recent improvements in computational power...
