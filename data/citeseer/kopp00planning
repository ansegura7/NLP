Planning and Motion Control in Lifelike Gesture: A Refined Approach In this paper an operational model for the automatic generation of lifelike gestures of an anthropomorphic virtual agent is described. The biologically motivated approach to controlling the movements of a highly articulated figure provides a transformation of spatiotemporal gesture specifications into an analog representation of the movement from which the animations are directly rendered. To this end, knowledge-based computer animation techniques are combined with appropriate methods for trajectory formation and articulated figure animation.  1. Introduction  The inclusion of nonverbal modalities into the communicative behaviors of virtual agents has moved into focus of human-computer interface researchers. Humans are more likely to consider computer-generated figures lifelike when appropriate nonverbal behaviors are displayed in addition to speech. This enables the evocation of social communicative attributions to the artificial agent, which are supposed to be advantageous for a natu...
