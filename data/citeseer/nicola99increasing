Increasing the Expressiveness of Analytical Performance Models for Replicated Databases . The vast number of design options in replicated databases requires efficient analytical performance evaluations so that the considerable overhead of simulations or measurements can be focused on a few promising options. A review of existing analytical models in terms of their modeling assumptions, replication schemata considered, and network properties captured, shows that data replication and intersite communication as well as workload patterns should be modeled more accurately. Based on this analysis, we define a new modeling approach named 2RC (2-dimensional replication model with integrated communication). We derive a complete analytical queueing model for 2RC and demonstrate that it is of higher expressiveness than existing models. 2RC also yields a novel bottleneck analysis and permits to evaluate the trade-off between throughput and availability. 1 Introduction  Replication management in distributed databases concerns the decision when and where to allocate physical copies of ...
