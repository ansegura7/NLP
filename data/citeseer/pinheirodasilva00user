User Interface Modelling with UML The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a natural candidate  for user interface (UI) modelling since it is the standard notation  for object oriented modelling of applications. However, it is by no means  clear how to model UIs using UML. This paper presents a user interface  modelling case study using UML. This case study identifies some  aspects of UIs that cannot be modelled using UML notation, and a set  of UML constructors that may be used to model UIs. The modelling  problems indicate some weaknesses of UML for modelling UIs, while  the constructors exploited indicate some strengths. The identification  of such strengths and weaknesses can be used in the formulation of a  strategy for extending UML to provide greater support for user interface  design.
