Automated Discovery of Concise Predictive Rules for Intrusion Detection This paper details an essential component of a multi-agent distributed knowledge network system  for intrusion detection. We describe a distributed intrusion detection architecture, complete with a  data warehouse and mobile and stationary agents for distributed problem-solving to facilitate building,  monitoring, and analyzing global, spatio-temporal views of intrusions on large distributed systems. An  agent for the intrusion detection system, which uses a machine learning approach to automated discovery  of concise rules from system call traces, is described.  We use a feature vector representation to describe the system calls executed by privileged processes.  The feature vectors are labeled as good or bad depending on whether or not they were executed during  an observed attack. A rule learning algorithm is then used to induce rules that can be used to monitor  the system and detect potential intrusions. We study the performance of the rule learning algorithm on  this task with an...
