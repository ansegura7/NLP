Trends In Evolutionary Robotics A review is given on the use of evolutionary techniques for the automatic design of adaptive robots. The focus is on methods which use neural networks and have been tested on actual physical robots. The chapter also examines the role of simulation and the use of domain knowledge in the evolutionary process. It concludes with some predictions about future directions in robotics.   Appeared in Soft Computing for Intelligent Robotic Systems, edited by L.C. Jain and T. Fukuda, PhysicaVerlag, New York, NY, 215--233, 1998.  1 Introduction  To be truly useful, robots must be adaptive. They should have a collection of basic abilities that can be brought to bear in tackling a variety of tasks in a wide range of environments. These fundamental abilities might include navigation to a goal location, obstacle avoidance, object recognition, and object manipulation. However, to date, this desired level of adaptability has not been realized. Instead, robots have primarily been successful when deploye...
