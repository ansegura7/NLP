MARS: a Programmable Coordination Architecture for Mobile Agents Mobile agents represent a promising technology for the development of Internet  applications. However, mobile computational entities introduce peculiar problems  w.r.t. the coordination of the application components. The paper outlines the  advantages of Linda-like coordination models, and shows how a programmable  coordination model based on reactive tuple spaces can provide further desirable  features for Internet applications based on mobile agents. Accordingly, the paper  presents the design and the implementation of the MARS coordination architecture for  Java-based mobile agents. MARS defines Linda-like tuple spaces, which can be  programmed to react with specific actions to the accesses made by mobile agents.
