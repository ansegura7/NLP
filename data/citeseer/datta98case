A Case for Parallelism in Data Warehousing and OLAP In recent years the database community has experienced a tremendous increase in the availability of new technologies to support efficient storage and retrieval of large volumes of data, namely data warehousing and  On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) products. Efficient query processing is critical in such an environment, yet achieving quick response times with OLAP queries is still largely an open issue. In this paper we propose a solution approach to this problem by applying  parallel processing techniques to a warehouse environment. We suggest an efficient partitioning strategy based on the relational representation of a data warehouse (i.e., star schema). Furthermore, we incorporate a particular indexing strategy, DataIndexes, to further improve query processing times and parallel resource utilization, and propose a preliminary parallel star-join strategy. 1 Introduction  In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the use of databases for decision support. This phenome...
