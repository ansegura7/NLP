Integration Of Speech And Vision Using Mutual Information We are developing a system which learns words from co-occurring spoken and visual input. The goal is to automatically segment continuous speechatword boundaries without a lexicon, and to form visual categories which correspond to spoken words. Mutual information is used to integrate acoustic and visual distance metrics in order to extract an audio-visual lexicon from raw input. Wereport  results of experiments with a corpus of infant-directed speech and images.  1. INTRODUCTION  We are developing systems which learn words from co-occurring  audio and visual input [5, 4]. Input consists of naturally spoken mutliword utterances paired with visual representations of object shapes (Figure 1). Output of the system is an audio-visual lexicon of sound-shape associations which encode acoustic forms of words (or phrases) and their visually grounded referents. We assume that, in general, the audio and visual signals are uncorrelated in time. However, when a wordisspoken, its visual representatio...
