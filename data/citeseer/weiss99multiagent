A Multiagent Framework for Planning, Reacting, and Learning .  There are two main approaches to activity coordination in multiagent systems, plan-based coordination and reactive coordination, each having its specic advantages and disadvantages. This paper describes a framework called M-Dyna-Q that aims at combining these two approaches such that their advantages are retained while their disadvantages are avoided. The key idea behind M-Dyna-Q, which is a multiagent variant of a single-agent framework known as Dyna-Q, is to achieve this combination through equipping the agents with the capability to learn information that is relevant to their planning and reacting activities. M-Dyna-Q thus oers an integrated view of planning, reacting, and learning in multiagent systems.  Keywords.  (M-)Dyna-Q, multiagent systems, reactive coordination, plan-based coordination, learning.  1 Introduction  The past years have witnessed a rapidly growing interest in multiagent systems (MAS), that is, in systems in which several interacting, intelligent and autono...
