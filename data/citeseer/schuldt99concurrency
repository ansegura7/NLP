Concurrency Control and Recovery in Transactional Process Management The classical theory of transaction management contains two different aspects, namely concurrency control and recovery, which ensure serializability and atomicity of transaction executions, respectively. Although concurrency control and recovery are not independent of each other, the criteria for these two aspects were developed orthogonally and as a result, in most cases these criteria are incompatible with each other. Recently a unified theory of concurrency control and recovery for databases with read and write operations has been introduced in [SWY93, AVA  +  94] that allows reasoning about serializability and atomicity within the same framework. In [SWY93, AVA  +  94] a class of schedules was introduced (called prefix reducible),  which guarantees both serializability and atomicity in a failure prone environment with read/write operations. Several protocols were developed to generate such schedules by a database concurrency control mechanism. We present here a unified transaction ...
