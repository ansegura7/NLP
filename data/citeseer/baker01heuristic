Heuristic Evaluation of Groupware Based on the Mechanics of Collaboration . Despite the increasing availability of groupware, most systems are  awkward and not widely used. While there are many reasons for this, a  significant problem is that groupware is difficult to evaluate. In particular, there  are no discount usability evaluation methodologies that can discover problems  specific to teamwork. In this paper, we describe how we adapted Nielsen's  heuristic evaluation methodology, designed originally for single user  applications, to help inspectors rapidly, cheaply effectively identify usability  problems within groupware systems. Specifically, we take the `mechanics of  collaboration' framework and restate it as heuristics for the purposes of  discovering problems in shared visual work surfaces for distance-separated  groups.  1.
