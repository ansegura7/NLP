Team Formation by Self-Interested Mobile Agents . A process of team formation by autonomous agents in a distributed  environment is presented. Since the environment is distributed,  there are serious problems with communication and consistent decision  making inside a team. To deal with these problems, the standard technique  of token passing in a computer network is applied. The passing  cycle of the token serves as the communication route. It assures consistent  decision making inside the team maintaining its organizational  integrity. On the other hand it constitutes a component of the plan of  the cooperative work performed by a complete team. Two algorithms for  team formation are given. The first one is based on simple self-interested  agents that still can be viewed as reactive agents (see [14]) although augmented  with knowledge, goal, and cooperation mechanisms. The second  one is based on sophisticated self-interested agents. Moreover, the algorithm  based on fully cooperative agents, which is an adaptation of the  static ...
