Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data using Graph Mincuts Many application domains suffer from not  having enough labeled training data for  learning. However, large amounts of unlabeled  examples can often be gathered  cheaply. As a result, there has been a great  deal of work in recent years on how unlabeled  data can be used to aid classification. We  consider an algorithm based on finding minimum  cuts in graphs, that uses pairwise relationships  among the examples in order to  learn from both labeled and unlabeled data.
