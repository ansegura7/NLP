Capturing and Querying Multiple Aspects of Semistructured Data Motivated to a large extent by the substantial and  growing prominence of the World-Wide Web and  the potential benefits that may be obtained by applying  database concepts and techniques to web  data management, new data models and query languages  have emerged that contend with web data.  These models organize data in graphs where nodes  denote objects or values and edges are labeled  with single words or phrases. Nodes are described  by the labels of the paths that lead to them, and  these descriptions serve as the basis for querying.  This paper proposes an extensible framework for  capturing and querying meta-data properties in a  semistructured data model. Properties such as  temporal aspects of data, prices associated with  data access, quality ratings associated with the  data, and access restrictions on the data are considered.  Specifically, the paper defines an extensible  data model and an accompanying query  language that provides new facilities for matching,  slicing, col...
