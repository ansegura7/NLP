On Case-Based Learnability of Languages Case-based reasoning is deemed an important technology to alleviate the bottleneck  of knowledge acquisition in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In case-based reasoning,  knowledge is represented in the form of particular cases with an appropriate similarity  measure rather than any form of rules. The case-based reasoning paradigm adopts the  view that an AI system is dynamically changing during its life-cycle which immediately  leads to learning considerations.  Within the present paper, we investigate the problem of case-based learning of  indexable classes of formal languages. Prior to learning considerations, we study the  problem of case-based representability and show that every indexable class is case-based  representable with respect to a fixed similarity measure. Next, we investigate several  models of case-based learning and systematically analyze their strengths as well as  their limitations. Finally, the general approach to case-based learnability of indexable  classes of form...
