Hypothesis Testing for Complex Agents As agents approach animal-like complexity, evaluating  them becomes as difficult as evaluating animals.  This paper describes the application of techniques for  characterizing animal behavior to the evaluation of complex  agents. We describe the conditions that lead to the  behavioral variability that requires experimental methods.  We then review the state of the art in psychological  experimental design and analysis, and show its  application to complex agents. We also discuss a specific  methodological concern of agent research: how the  robots versus simulations debate interacts with statistical  evaluation. Finally, we make a specific proposal for  facilitating the use of scientific method. We propose the  creation of a web site that functions as a repository for  platforms suitable for statistical testing, for results determined  on those platforms, and for the agents that have  generated those results.  Keywords: agent performance, complex systems, behavioral indeterminacy, repl...
