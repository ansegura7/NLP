Relevance Feedback and Query Expansion for Searching the Web: A Model for Searching a Digital Library :  A fully operational large scale digital library is likely to be based on a distributed architecture and because of this it is likely that a number of independent search engines may be used to index different overlapping portions of the entire contents of the library. In any case, different media, text, audio, image, etc., will be indexed for retrieval by different search engines so techniques which provide a coherent and unified search over a suite of underlying independent search engines are thus likely to be an important part of navigating in a digital library. In this paper we present an architecture and a system for searching the world's largest DL, the world wide web. What makes our system novel is that we use a suite of underlying web search engines to do the bulk of the work while our system orchestrates them in a parallel fashion to provide a higher level of information retrieval functionality. Thus it is our meta search engine and not the underlying direct search engines th...
