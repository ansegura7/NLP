For instance, web sites containing information on restaurants, theaters, and apartment  rentals are relevant primarily to web users in geographical proximity to these locations.  In contrast, other information resources are relevant to a broader geographical community. For  instance, an on-line newspaper may be relevant to users across the United States. Unfortunately,  the geographical scope of web resources is largely ignored by web search engines. We  make the case for identifying and exploiting the geographical location information of web sites  so that web search engines can rank resources in a geographically sensitive fashion, in addition  to using more traditional information-retrieval strategies. In this paper, we first consider how  to compute the geographical location of web pages. Subsequently, we consider how to exploit  such information in one specific "proof-of-concept" appl...
