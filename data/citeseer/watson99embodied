Embodied Evolution: Embodying an Evolutionary Algorithm in a Population of Robots We introduce Embodied Evolution (EE) as a methodology for the automatic design of robotic controllers. EE is an evolutionary robotics (ER) technique that avoids the pitfalls of the simulate-and-transfer method, allows the speed-up of evaluation time by utilizing parallelism, and is particularly suited to future work on multi-agent behaviors. In EE, an evolutionary algorithm is distributed amongst and embodied within a population of physical robots that reproduce with one another while situated in the task environment. We have built a population of eight robots and successfully implemented our first experiments. The controllers evolved by EE compare favorably to hand-designed solutions for a simple task. We detail our methodology, report our initial results, and discuss the application of EE to more advanced and distributed robotics tasks. 1. Introduction  Our work is inspired by the following vision. A large number of robots freely interact with each other in a shared environment, atte...
