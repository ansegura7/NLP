Normal Forms and Proofs in Combined Modal and Temporal Logics . In this paper we present a framework for the combination of  modal and temporal logic. This framework allows us to combine different  normal forms, in particular, a separated normal form for temporal  logic and a first-order clausal form for modal logics. The calculus of the  framework consists of temporal resolution rules and standard first-order  resolution rules.  We show that the calculus provides a sound, complete, and terminating  inference systems for arbitrary combinations of subsystems of multimodal   S5 with linear, temporal logic.  1
