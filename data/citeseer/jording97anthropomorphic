An Anthropomorphic Agent for the Use of Spatial Language . In this paper we describe the communication with a responsive  virtual environment with the main emphasis on the processing of  spatial expressions in natural language instructions. This work is part  of the VIENA project in whichwechose interior design as an example  domain. A multiagent system acts as an intelligent mediator between the  user and a graphics system. To make the communication about spatial  relations more intuitive, we developed an anthropomorphic agent which  is graphically visualized in the scene. Considering the human-like #gure  we explain the use of qualitative spatial expressions, like #right of " and  #there".  1 Introduction  Interactive 3-dimensional graphics systems are more useful #e.g. in design#, when users can concentrate on their imaginations and be free from technical considerations. Therefore it is important to improveinteraction with the virtual environmentbyway of natural, intuitive communication forms.  In our work we consider a #virtual interface...
