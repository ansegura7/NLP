Constraints and Agents in MADEsmart As part of the DARPA Rapid Design Exploration and Optimization (RaDEO) program, Boeing, Philadelphia, is involved in an on-going concurrent design engineering research project called MADEsmart which seeks to partially automate the Integrated Product Team (IPT) concept used by Boeing for organizing the design engineering process, with the aid of intelligent agent technology. Although currently only in an early stage of development, the project is expected to crucially employ a constraint-centered System Design Management Agent developed by the University of Toronto's IE Department in conjunction with Boeing. The SDMA will use the constraint-based Toronto Ontologies for a Virtual Enterprise (TOVE) ontologies, and its domain theories for design engineering and dependent underlying theories, phrased as KIF/Ontolingua assertions in an axiomatic system running in the constraint logic system ECLiPSe, as its primary knowledge resource to monitor an ongoing design project, offering resource-all...
