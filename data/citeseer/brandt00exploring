Exploring auction-based leveled-commitment contracting - Part I: English-type auctioning A key problem addressed in the area of multiagent systems is the automated  assignment of multiple tasks to executing agents. The automation  of multiagent task assignment requires that the individual agents (i) use  a common protocol that prescribes how they have to interact in order to  come to an agreement and (ii) fix their final agreement in a contract that  specifies the commitments resulting from the assignment on which they  agreed. This report describes a novel approach to automated task assignment  in multiagent systems that is based on an auction-based protocol  and on leveled commitment contracting. This approach is applicable in a  broad range of realistic scenarios in which knowledge-intensive negotiation  among agents is not feasible and in which future environmental changes  may require agents to breach their contracts.  1 Introduction  The area of multiagent systems (e.g., [5, 8, 16]), which is concerned with systems composed of technical entities called agents that in...
