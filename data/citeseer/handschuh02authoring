Authoring and Annotation of Web Pages in CREAM Richly interlinked, machine-understandable data constitute the basis for the Semantic Web.  We provide a framework, CREAM, that allows for creation of metadata. While the annotation  mode of CREAM allows to create metadata for existing web pages, the authoring mode lets  authors create metadata --- almost for free --- while putting together the content of a page.  As a particularity of our framework, CREAM allows to create relational metadata, i.e. metadata  that instantiate interrelated definitions of classes in a domain ontology rather than a comparatively  rigid template-like schema as Dublin Core. We discuss some of the requirements one  has to meet when developing such an ontology-based framework, e.g. the integration of a metadata  crawler, inference services, document management and a meta-ontology, and describe its  implementation, viz. Ont-O-Mat a component-based, ontology-driven Web page authoring and  annotation tool.
