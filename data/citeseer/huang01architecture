An Architecture For Web Agents In this paper we propose an extended BDI architecture for web agents. The architecture is general, it covers 2D web agent with text based interfaces for retrieval services as well as 3D web agents like avatar-embodied guides that help visitors to navigate in virtual environments. Furthermore, we define the primitives of sensor/effector of web agents, and show how those different types of web agents can be implemented, based on the general architecture.
