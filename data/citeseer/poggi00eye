Eye communication in a conversational 3D synthetic agent this paper, we concentrate on the study and generation of coordinated linguistic and gaze communicative acts. In this view we analyse gaze signals according to their functional meaning rather than to their physical actions. We propose a formalism where a communicative act is represented by two elements: a meaning (that corresponds to a set of goals and beliefs that the agent has the purpose to transmit to the interlocutor) and a signal, that is the nonverbal expression of that meaning. We also outline a methodology to generate messages that coordinate verbal with nonverbal signals.
