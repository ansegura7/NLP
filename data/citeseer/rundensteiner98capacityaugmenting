Capacity-Augmenting Schema Changes on Object-Oriented Databases: Towards Increased Interoperability The realization of capacity-augmenting schema changes on a shared database while providing continued interoperability to active applications has been recognized as a hard open problem. A novel three-pronged process, called transparent object schema evolution (TOSE), is presented that successfully addresses this problem. TOSE uses the combination of views and versioning to simulate schema changes requested by one application without affecting other applications interoperating on a shared OODB. The approach is of high practical relevance as it builds upon schema evolution support offered by commercial OODBMSs. Keywords: Transparent schema evolution, object-oriented views, object-oriented databases, application migration. 1 Introduction  Current schema evolution technology suffers from the problem that schema updates on a database shared by interoperating applications often have catastrophic consequences [BKKK87, KC88, MS93, PS87, TS93, Zic91]. In such a multi-user environment, a schema c...
