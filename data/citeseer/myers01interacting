Interacting At a Distance Using Semantic Snarfing . It is difficult to interact with computer displays that are across the  room, which can be important in meetings and when controlling computerized  devices. A popular approach is to use laser pointers tracked by a camera, but interaction  techniques using laser pointers tend to be imprecise, error-prone, and  slow. Therefore, we have developed a new interaction style, where the laser  pointer (or other pointing technique such pointing with a finger or even eye  tracking) indicates the region of interest, and then the item there is copied  ("snarfed") to the user's handheld device, such as a Palm or PocketPC handheld.  If the content changes on the PC, the handheld's copy will be updated as well.  Interactions can be performed on the handheld using familiar direct manipulation  techniques, and then the modified version is sent back to the PC. The content  often must be reformatted to fit the properties of the handheld to facilitate  natural interaction.  1
