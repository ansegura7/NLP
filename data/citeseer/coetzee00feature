Feature Selection in Web Applications Using ROC Inflections and Power Set Pruning A basic problem of information processing is selecting enough features to ensure that events are accurately  represented for classification problems, while simultaneously minimizing storage and processing  of irrelevant or marginally important features. To address this problem, feature selection procedures  perform a search through the feature power set to find the smallest subset meeting performance requirements.  Major restrictions of existing procedures are that they typically explicitly or implicitly assume a  fixed operating point, and make limited use of the statistical structure of the feature power set. We present  a method that combines the Neyman-Pearson design procedure on finite data, with the directed set structure  of the Receiver Operating Curves on the feature subsets, to determine the maximal size of the feature  subsets that can be ranked in a given problem. The search can then be restricted to the smaller subsets, resulting  in significant reductions in computational...
