Uncertain Knowledge Representation and Communicative Behavior in Coordinated Defense This paper reports on results we obtained on communication among artificial and human agents interacting in a simulated air defense domain. In our research, we postulate that the artificial agents use a decision-theoretic method to select optimal communicative acts, given the characteristics of the particular situation. Thus, the agents we implemented compute the expected utilities of various alternative communicative acts, and execute the best one. The agents use a probabilistic frame-based knowledge formalism to represent the uncertain information they have about the domain and about the other agents present. We build on our earlier work that uses the Recursive Modeling Method (RMM) for coordination, and apply RMM to rational communication in an anti-air defense domain. In this domain, distributed units coordinate and communicate to defend a specified territory from a number of attacking missiles. We measure the benefits of rational communication by showing the improvement in the qua...
