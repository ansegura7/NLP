An Overview of the Multiagent Systems Engineering Methodology . To solve complex problems, agents work cooperatively with other  agents in heterogeneous environments. We are interested in coordinating the  local behavior of individual agents to provide an appropriate system-level  behavior. The use of intelligent agents provides an even greater amount of  flexibility to the ability and configuration of the system itself. With these new  intricacies, software development is becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore,  it is critical that our processes for building the inherently complex distributed  software that must run in this environment be adequate for the task. This paper  introduces a methodology for designing these systems of interacting agents.  1.
