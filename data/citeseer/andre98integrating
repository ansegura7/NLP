Integrating Reactive and Scripted Behaviors in a Life-Like Presentation Agent Animated agents- based either on real video, cartoon-style drawings or even model-based 3D graphics- offer great promise for computer-based presentations as they make presentations more lively and appealing and allow for the emulation of conversation styles known from human-human communication. In this paper, we describe a life-like interface agent which presents multimedia material to the user following the directives of a script. The overall behavior of the presentation agent is partly determined by such a script, and partly by the agent's self-behavior. In our approach, the agent's behavior is defined in a declarative specification language. Behavior specifications are used to automatically generate a control module for an agent display system. The first part of the paper describes the generation process which involves AI planning and a two-step compilation. Since the manual creation of presentation scripts is tedious and error-prone, we also address the automated generation of presentation scripts which may be forwarded to the interface agent. The second part of the paper presents an approach for multimedia presentation design which combines hierarchical planning with temporal reasoning. 1.1 Keywords human-like qualities of synthetic agents, life-like qualities, presentation agents
