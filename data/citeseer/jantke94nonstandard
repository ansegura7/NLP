Nonstandard Concepts of Similarity in Case-Based Reasoning Introduction  The present paper is aimed at propagating new concepts of similarity more flexible and expressive than those underlying most case-based reasoning approaches today. So, it mainly deals with criticizing approaches in use, with motivating and introducing new notions and notations, and with first steps towards future applications. The investigations at hand originate from the author's work in learning theory. In exploring the relationship between inductive learning and case-based learning within a quite formal setting (cf. [Jan92b]), it turned out that both areas almost coincide, if sufficiently flexible similarity concepts are taken into acount. This provides some formal arguments for the necessity of non-symmetric similarity measures. Encouraged by these first results, the author tried to investigate more structured learning problems from the view point of case-based reasoning. It turned out that an appropriate handling requires formalisms allowing similarity concep
