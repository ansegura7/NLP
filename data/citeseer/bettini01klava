Klava: a Java Framework for Distributed and Mobile Applications Highly distributed networks have now become a common infrastructure for a new  kind of wide-area distributed applications whose key design principle is network awareness,  namely the ability of dealing with dynamic changes of the network environment.  Network-aware computing has called for new programming languages that exploit the  mobility paradigm as a basic interaction mechanism. In this paper we present the architecture  of Klava, an experimental Java framework for distributed applications and  code mobility. We explain how Klava implements code mobility by relying on Java  and show a few distributed applications that exploit mobile code and are programmed  in Klava.  Keywords: Code Mobility, Distributed Applications, Network Awareness, Language and Middleware Implementation, Tuple Spaces, Java.  1
