Feature Reduction for Neural Network Based Text Categorization In a text categorization model using an artificial neural network as the text classifier, scalability is poor if the neural network is trained using the raw feature space since textural data has a very high-dimension feature space. We proposed and compared four dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the feature space into an input space of much lower dimension for the neural network classifier. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments were conducted using a subset of the Reuters-22173 test collection for text categorization. The results showed that the proposed model was able to achieve high categorization effectiveness as measured by precision and recall. Among the four dimensionality reduction techniques proposed, Principal Component Analysis was found to be the most effective in reducing the dimensionality of the feature space. 1. Introduction  Text categorization is the classification of text documents into a set of one or more categories. In this paper, ...
