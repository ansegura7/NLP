Coordinating Mobile Agents by means of Communicators This paper proposes a coordination model, for both static and mobile agents, based on abstract structures called Communicators, entities which handle agent dialogue performed through ACL speech act exchanging. Such structures are designed based on a need to model agent dialogue in a human-like style, offering a set of coordination primitives of general validity, able to provide both a direct and indirect interaction model. Since a Communicator handles messages exchanged within a well-defined multi-agent application, it is fully programmable, i.e. it is possible to specify what messages can be exchanged and how these message have to be handled. In detail, a Communicator performs a syntactic and semantic routing, allowing the exchange and forwarding of a message according to the programmed coordination laws.
