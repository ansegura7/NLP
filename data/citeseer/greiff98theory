A Theory of Term Weighting Based on Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques of exploratory data analysis are used to study the weight of evidence that the occurrence of a query term provides in support of the hypothesis that a document is relevant to an information need. In particular, the relationship between the document frequency and the weight of evidence is investigated. A correlation between document frequency normalized by collection size and the mutual information between relevance and term occurrence is uncovered. This correlation is found to be robust across a variety of query sets and document collections. Based on this relationship, a theoretical explanation of the efficacy of inverse document frequency for term weighting is developed which differs in both style and content from theories previously put forth. The theory predicts that a "flattening" of idf at both low and high frequency should result in improved retrieval performance. This altered idf formulation is tested on all TREC query sets. Retrieval results corroborate the predicti...
