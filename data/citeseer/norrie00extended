An Extended Entity-Relationship Approach to Data Management in Object-Oriented Systems Database programming in object-oriented systems can be supported by combining data  modelling and programming technologies such that a data model supports the management of  collections of objects where those objects are as specified by the underlying object-oriented programming  language. This approach is the basis of the object data management services (ODMS)  of the Comandos system. The ODMS data model provides constructs for the representation of  both entities and their relationships and further supports rich classification structures. To complement  the structural model, there is an operational model based on an algebra over collections  of objects.  1 Introduction  Object-oriented technologies are gaining in popularity as the basis for software development platforms. Meanwhile the family of entity-relationship data models retain their wide-spread use and popularity for conceptual modelling. How then can these two successful technologies be combined to support the development of ...
