Dynamic Agent Population in Agent-Based Distance Vector Routing The Intelligent mobile agent paradigm can be applied to a wide variety of intrinsically parallel and distributed applications. Network routing is one such application that can be mapped to an agent-based approach. The performance of any agent-based system will depend on its agent population. Although a lot of research has been conducted on agent-based systems, little consideration has been given to the importance of agent population in dynamic networks. A large number of constituent agents can increase the resource overhead of the system, thereby impeding the overall performance of the network.
