Improving the Wang and Mendel's Fuzzy Rule Learning Method by Inducing Cooperation Among Rules Nowadays, Linguistic Modeling (LM) is considered  to be one of the most important areas  of application for Fuzzy Logic. It is accomplished  by descriptive Fuzzy Rule-Based  Systems (FRBSs), whose most interesting  feature is the interpolative reasoning they  develop. This characteristic plays a key role  in the high performance of FRBSs and is a  consequence of the cooperation among the  fuzzy rules involved in the FRBS.  A large quantity of automatic techniques has  been proposed to generate these fuzzy rules  from numerical data. One of the most interesting  families of techniques, due to its  simplicity and quickness, is the ad hoc datadriven  methods. However, its main drawback  is the cooperation among the rules  which is not suitably considered.  With the aim of facing up this drawback,  which makes the obtained models not to  be as accurate as desired, a new approach  to improve the performance obtaining more  cooperative rules is introduced in this paper.  Following this appro...
