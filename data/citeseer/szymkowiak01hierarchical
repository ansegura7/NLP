Hierarchical Clustering for Datamining . This paper presents hierarchical probabilistic clustering methods for unsupervised  and supervised learning in datamining applications. The probabilistic clustering  is based on the previously suggested Generalizable Gaussian Mixture model.  A soft version of the Generalizable Gaussian Mixture model is also discussed. The  proposed hierarchical scheme is agglomerative and based on a  L 2 distance metric.  Unsupervised and supervised schemes are successfully tested on artificially data and  for segmention of e-mails.  1
