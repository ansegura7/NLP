X-Klaim and Klava: Programming Mobile Code Highly distributed networks have now become a common infrastructure for a new kind of wide-area distributed applications whose key design principle is network awareness, namely the ability to deal with dynamic changes of the network environment. Network-aware computing has called for new programming languages that exploit the mobility paradigm as the basic interaction mechanism. In this paper we present the Klaim (Kernel Language for Agent Interaction and Mobility) framework for programming mobile code applications, namely the X-Klaim programming language and the Java-based run-time system Klava. In particular, we illustrate how Klava handles mobile code. Finally, an example is shown that is implemented using this framework.
