Practical Dependency Analysis through a Share Quotient Def , the domain of definite Boolean functions, expresses (sure) dependencies between the program variables of, say, a constraint program. The domain Share, on the other hand, captures the (possible) variable sharing between the variables of a logic program. The connection between these domains has been explored in the domain comparison, quotienting and decomposition literature. We develop this link further and show how the meet (as well as the join) of Def can be modelled with efficient (quadratic) operations on Share. We show how the connection leads to an attractive way of constructing a dependency analysis and how widening can make the approach practical.
