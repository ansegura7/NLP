Impact: A Platform for Collaborating Agents twork. The Impact server provides the infrastructure upon which different Impact agents can interact. To avoid a performance bottleneck, multiple copies of the server can be replicated and scattered across the network. Impact agents A set of data objects can be represented in a wide variety of ways. When building an application, we'd like to select a data structure that supports the application operations that are the most frequently executed, the most critical, or both. So, any definition of an agent must support such flexible choice of data structures, and agentization must let us extend arbitrary data representations. In Impact, an agent consists of any body of software code whatsoever, with the associated wrapper. Figure 2 shows such an agent's architecture. The software code. The agent's code consists of two parts: . a set of data structures (or data types) manipulated by the agent. For example, if we are building a database agen
