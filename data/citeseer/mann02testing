Testing Access To External Information Sources in a Mediator Environment This paper discusses the testing of communication in the increasingly important class of distributed information systems that are based on a mediator architecture. A mediator integrates existing information sources into a new application. In order to answer complex queries, the mediator splits them up into subqueries which it sends to the information sources, and it combines the replies to answer the original query. Since the information sources are usually remote, autonomous systems, the access to them can be erroneous, most notably when the information source is subject to modifications. Such errors may result in incorrect behaviour of the whole system. This paper addresses the problem of deciding whether an information source as part of a mediatory system was successfully queried or not. The primary contribution is a formal framework for the general information access testing problem. Besides proposing several solutions, it is investigated what the most important quality measures of such testing methods are. Moreover, the practical usability of the presented approaches is demonstrated on a real-world application using Web-based information sources. Several empirical experiments are conductedto compare the presented methods with previous work in the field.
