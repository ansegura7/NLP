On the Expressivity and Complexity of Temporal Conceptual Modelling The contribution of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it introduces T DLR, a novel temporal  logic for temporal conceptual modelling, motivated as the obvious generalisation of the successful DLR  Description Logic. Tight decidability and complexity results are proved for T DLR and the monodic  fragment of it (T DLR ). Moreover, the decidability of conjunctive query containment under T DLR  constraints is proved. On the other hand, the paper provides a formal semantic characterisation of all  the important temporal conceptual modelling constructs (for valid time representation) as found in the  literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic formalisation of the constructs present  in most temporal conceptual modelling systems. This systematic characterisation as T DLR theories is an  evidence of the adequacy of the T DLR temporal Description Logic for temporal conceptual modelling.  1 Introduction  In this paper the novel T DLR temporal logic is introduced...
