Measuring the Structural Similarity among XML Documents and DTDs Sources of XML documents are proliferating on the Web and documents are more and more frequently exchanged among sources. At the same time, there is an increasing need of exploiting database tools to manage this kind of data. An important novelty of XML is that information on document structures is available on the Web together with the document contents. This information can be used to improve document handling and to achieve more effective and efficient searches on documents. However, in such an heterogeneous environment as the Web, it is not reasonable to assume that XML documents that enter a source always conform to a predefined DTD present in the source.
