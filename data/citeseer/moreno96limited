Limited Logical Belief Analysis . The process of rational inquiry can be defined as the evolution of a rational agent's belief set as a consequence of its internal inference procedures and its interaction with the environment. These beliefs can be modelled in a formal way using doxastic logics. The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically omniscient and perfect reasoners. These problems can be avoided with a syntactic view of possible worlds, defining them as arbitrary sets of sentences in a propositional doxastic logic. In this paper this syntactic view of possible worlds is taken, and a dynamic analysis of the agent's beliefs is suggested in order to model the process of rational inquiry in which the agent is permanently engaged. One component of this analysis, the logical one, is summarily described. This dimension of analysis is performed using a modified version of the analytic tableaux...
