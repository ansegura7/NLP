Nomadic Radio: Scaleable and Contextual Notification for Wearable Audio Messaging Mobile workers need seamless access to communication and information services on portable devices. However current solutions overwhelm users with intrusive and ambiguous notifications. In this paper, we describe scaleable auditory techniques and a contextual notification model for providing timely information, while minimizing  interruptions. User's actions influence local adaptation in the model. These techniques are demonstrated in Nomadic Radio, an audio-only wearable computing platform.
