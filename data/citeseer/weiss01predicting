Predicting Telecommunication Equipment Failures from Sequences of Network Alarms The computer and telecommunication industries rely heavily on knowledge-based  expert systems to manage the performance of their networks. These expert systems are  developed by knowledge engineers, who must first interview domain experts to extract  the pertinent knowledge. This knowledge acquisition process is laborious and costly,  and typically is better at capturing qualitative knowledge than quantitative knowledge.  This is a liability, especially for domains like the telecommunication domain, where  enormous amounts of data are readily available for analysis. Data mining holds  tremendous promise for the development of expert systems for monitoring network  performance since it provides a way of automatically identifying subtle, yet important,  patterns in data. This case study describes a project in which a temporal data mining  system called Timeweaver is used to identify faulty telecommunication equipment from  logs of network alarm messages.  Project Overview  Managing the p...
