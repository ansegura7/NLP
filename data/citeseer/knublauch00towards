Towards a Multi-Agent System for Pro-active Information Management in Anesthesia . Decision-making in anesthesia requires the integration of information  from various clinical data sources, such as the patient, the  laboratory, the surgery and the clinical personnel. However, information  management and processing is aggravated by the highly heterogeneous  and distributed nature of the current clinical data and information  repositories. Furthermore, critical situations such as the arrival of emergency  patients demand the context-sensitive provision of information in  a timely fashion. We argue that multi-agent architectures can help to  overcome these problems. In the clinical information space, autonomous  agents can pro-actively collect, integrate and analyze the required data  and condense and communicate the most relevant information. In this  paper, we presentanapproach for an anesthesia information management  system based on intelligent agents.  1 Introduction  The anesthesiological department is an essential service provider in modern clinical health care...
