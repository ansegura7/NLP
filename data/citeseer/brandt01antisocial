Antisocial Agents and Vickrey Auctions In recent years auctions have become more and more important in  the field of multiagent systems as useful mechanisms for resource allocation and  task assignment. In many cases the Vickrey (second-price sealed-bid) auction  is used as a protocol that prescribes how the individual agents have to interact  in order to come to an agreement. We show that the Vickrey auction, despite  its theoretical benefits, is inappropriate if "antisocial" agents participate in the  auction process. More specifically, an antisocial attitude for economic agents that  makes reducing the profit of competitors their main goal besides maximizing their  own profit is introduced. Under this novel condition, agents need to deviate from  the dominant truth-telling strategy. This paper presents a strategy for bidders in  repeated Vickrey auctions who are intending to inflict losses to fellow agents in  order to be more successful, not in absolute measures, but relatively to the group  of bidders. The strategy is evaluated in a simple task allocation scenario.
