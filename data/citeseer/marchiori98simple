A Simple Heuristic Based Genetic Algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem This paper proposes a novel heuristic based genetic algorithm  (HGA) for the maximum clique problem, which consists of the combination of a simple genetic algorithm and a naive heuristic algorithm. The heuristic based genetic algorithm is tested on the so-called DIMACS benchmark graphs, with up to 4000 nodes and up to 5506380 edges, consisting of randomly generated graphs with known maximum clique and of graphs derived from various practical applications. The performance of HGA on these graphs is very satisfactory both in terms of solution quality and running time. Despite its simplicity, HGA dramatically improves on all previous approaches based on genetic algorithms we are aware of, and yields results comparable to those of more involved heuristic algorithms based on local search. This provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of heuristic based genetic algorithms as a search technique for solving the maximum clique problem, which is competitive with respect to other (variants...
