Virtual Information Towers - A Metaphor for Intuitive, Location-Aware Information Access in a Mobile Environment This paper introduces Virtual Information Towers (VITs) as a concept for presenting and accessing location-aware information with mobile clients. A VIT is a means of structuring location-aware information, which is assigned to a certain geographical position while having a certain area of visibility. A user equipped with a mobile, wearable computer has access to the VITs which are "visible" from his/her current location. The architecture and protocols of a system are described, which allows its users to create VITs and to access the information on them using Internet mechanisms. We have implemented a prototype of this system and a VIT client for a wearable computer and will present some aspects of this implementation. 1 Introduction  Mobile information access is an important field of application for wearable computers. In a mobile environment much of the accessed information is location-dependent, i.e. the content of the information or the user's interest in the information depends on ...
