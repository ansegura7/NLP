Evolving Rule-Based Trading Systems In this study, a market trading rulebase is optimised using genetic programming  (GP). The rulebase is comprised of simple relationships between technical  indicators, and generates signals to buy, sell short, and remain inactive. The  methodology is applied to prediction of the Standard & Poor's composite index  (02-Jan-1990 to 18-Oct-2001). Two potential market systems are inferred: a simple  system using few rules and nodes, and a more complex system. Results are  compared with a benchmark buy-and-hold strategy. Neither trading system was  found capable of consistently outperforming this benchmark. More complicated  rulebases, in addition to being difficult to understand, are susceptible to overfitting.
