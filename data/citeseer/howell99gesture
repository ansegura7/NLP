Gesture Recognition for Visually Mediated Interaction . This paper reports initial research on supporting Visually Mediated Interaction  (VMI) by developing person-specific and generic gesture models for the  control of active cameras. We describe a time-delay variant of the Radial Basis  Function (TDRBF) network and evaluate its performance on recognising simple  pointing and waving hand gestures in image sequences. Experimental results  are presented that show that high levels of performance can be obtained for this  type of gesture recognition using such techniques, both for particular individuals  and across a set of individuals. Characteristic visual evidence can be automatically  selected, depending on the task demands.  1 Introduction  In general, robust tracking of non-rigid objects such as human bodies is difficult due to rapid motion, occlusion and ambiguities in segmentation and model matching. Ongoing research at the MIT Media Lab has shown progress in the modelling and interpretation of human body activity [24, 30, 31]. Compu...
