Dynamic Reconfiguration in Collaborative Problem Solving In this article we will describe our research efforts in coping with a trade-off that can be often found in the control and optimization of todays business processes. Though centralized control may achieve nearto -optimum results in optimizing the system behavior, there are usually social, technical and security restrictions on applying centralized control. Distributed control on the other hand may cope with these restrictions but also entails sub-optimality and communicational overhead. Our concept of composable agents tries to allow a dynamic and fluent transition between globalization and localization in business process control by adapting to the current real-world system structure. We are currently evaluating this concept in the framework of patient flow control at Charit'e Berlin.  Introduction  Research in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI, (Bond & Gasser 1988)) has been traditionally divided into Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) and Multi Agent Systems (MAS). However, r...
