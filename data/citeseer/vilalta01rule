Rule Induction of Computer Events Introduction  Monitoring systems are able to capture an assortment of different events from a network environment. A single event signals an abnormal situation on either one host, e.g., "cpu utilization is above a critical threshold", or the network, e.g., "communication link is down". A monitoring system can capture thousands of events in a short time period (several days); applying data analysis techniques (e.g., machine-learning, data-mining) on those events may reveal useful patterns characterizing a network problem. Data analysis techniques have proved useful in the area of network fault management.  In this paper we consider the following scenario. A computer network is under continuous monitoring; a user is interested in identifying what triggers a specific kind of events, which we refer to as target events. The user would like to know what events correlate to each target event within a fixed time window. We describe a data-mining technique that takes as input
