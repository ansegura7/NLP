Supporting Group Collaboration with Inter-Personal Awareness Devices . An Inter-Personal Awareness Device, or IPAD, is a hand-held or  wearable device designed to support awareness and collaboration between  people who are in the physical vicinity of each other. An IPAD is designed to  supply constant awareness information to users in any location without relying  on an underlying infrastructure.

We argue that IPADs such as th...
