It is claimed that not only following norms, but also the possibility of `intelligent' norm violation can be useful. Principles for agents that are able to behave deliberately on the basis of explicitly represented norms are identified and an architecture is introduced. Using this agent architecture, norms can be communicated, adopted and used as meta-goals on the agent's own processes. As such they have impact on deliberation about goal generation, goal selection, plan generation and plan selection. 1 Introduction Besides autonomy, an important characteristic of agents is that they can react to a changing environment.
