Management of XML Documents in an Integrated Digital Library We describe a generalized toolset developed by the Perseus Project to  manage XML documents in the context of a large, heterogeneous digital  library. The system manages multiple DTDs through mappings from elements  in the DTD to abstract document structures. The abstraction of  document metadata, both structural and descriptive, facilitates the development  of application-level tools for knowledge management and document  presentation. We discuss the implementation of the XML back  end and describe applications for cross citation retrieval, toponym extraction  and plotting, automatic hypertext generation, morphology, and word  co-occurrence.  1
