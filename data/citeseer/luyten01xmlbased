An XML-based runtime user interface description language for mobile computing devices In a time where mobile computing devices and embedded  systems gain importance, too much time is spent to reinventing user interfaces  for each new device. To enhance future extensibility and reusability  of systems and their user interfaces we propose a runtime user interface  description language, which can cope with constraints found in  embedded systems and mobile computing devices. XML seems to be a  suitable tool to do this, when combined with Java. Following the evolution  of Java towards XML, it is logical to introduce the concept applied  to mobile computing devices and embedded systems.  1
