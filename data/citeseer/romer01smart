Smart Playing Cards: A Ubiquitous Computing Game Abstract. Recent technological advances allow for turning parts of our everyday environment into so???called smart environments. In this paper we present the ???Smart Playing Cards ??? application, a ubiquitous computing game that augments a classical card game with information???technological functionality, in contrast to developing new games around the abilities of available technology. Furthermore, we present the requirements such an application makes on a supporting software infrastructure for ubiquitous computing.
