Feature Subset Selection Using A Genetic Algorithm Practical pattern classification and knowledge discovery problems require selection of a subset of attributes or features (from a much larger set) to represent the patterns to be classified. This paper presents an approach to the multi-criteria optimization problem of feature subset selection using a genetic algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for feature subset selection in the automated design of neural networks for pattern classification and knowledge discovery. 1 Introduction Many practical pattern classification tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis) require learning of an appropriate classification function that assigns a given input pattern (typically represented using a vector of attribute or feature values) to one of a finite set of classes. The choice of features, attributes, or measurements used to represent patterns that are presented to a classifier affect (among other things): ffl The accuracy of the classification function that can be learn...
