A Comparison of Techniques to Find Mirrored Hosts on the WWW We compare several algorithms for identifying mirrored hosts on the World Wide Web. The algorithms operate on the basis of URL strings and linkage data: the type of information easily available from web proxies and crawlers. Identification of mirrored hosts can improve web-based information retrieval in several ways: First, by identifying mirrored hosts, search engines can avoid storing and returning duplicate documents. Second, several new information retrieval techniques for the Web make inferences based on the explicit links among hypertext documents -- mirroring perturbs their graph model and degrades performance. Third, mirroring information can be used to redirect users to alternate mirror sites to compensate for various failures, and can thus improve the performance of web browsers and proxies.  # This work was presented at the Workshop on Organizing Web Space at the Fourth ACM Conference on Digital Libraries 1999.  We evaluated 4 classes of "top-down" algorithms for detecting ...
