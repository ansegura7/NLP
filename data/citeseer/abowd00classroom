Classroom 2000: An Experiment with the Instrumentation of a Living Educational Environment One potentially useful feature of future computing environments is the ability to capture the live experiences of the occupants and to provide that record to users for later access and review. Over the last 3 years, we have designed and extensively used a particular instrumented environment, the classroom, designed to facilitate the easy capture of the traditional lecture experience. We will describe the history of the Classroom 2000 project at Georgia Tech, and provide results of extended evaluations of the impact of automated capture on the teaching and learning experience. In addition to understanding the impact of automated capture in this educational domain, there are many important lessons to take away from this long-term, largescale experiment with a living ubiquitous computing environment. The environment needs to address issues of scale and extensibility, and there needs to be a way to continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the environment and understand and react to the w...
