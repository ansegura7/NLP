Design And Implementation Of The J-Seal2 Mobile Agent Kernel J-SEAL2 is a secure, portable, and efficient execution environment for mobile agents. The core of the system is a micro-kernel fulfilling the same functions as a traditional operating system kernel: protection, communication, domain termination, and resource control. This paper describes the key concepts of the J-SEAL2 micro-kernel and how they are implemented in pure Java.
