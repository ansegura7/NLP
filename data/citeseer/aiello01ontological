Ontological Overhearing The collaboration between two intelligent agents can be greatly enhanced  if a third agent, who has some understanding of the communication between  the first two, intervenes giving appropriate information or acting helpfully  without having been explicitly involved. The behavior of this third agent, quite  common in human interaction, is called overhearing. We present an agent architecture  modeling this behavior. In particular, we focus on overhearing based on  ontological reasoning; that is, the overhearer semantically selects pieces of communication  according to his own knowledge (ontologically organized) and goals.
