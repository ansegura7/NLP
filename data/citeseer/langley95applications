Applications of Machine Learning and Rule Induction An important area of application for machine learning is in automating the acquisition of knowledge bases required for expert systems. In this paper, we review the major paradigms for machine learning, including neural networks, instance-based methods, genetic learning, rule induction, and analytic approaches. We consider rule induction in greater detail and review some of its recent applications, in each case stating the problem, how rule induction was used, and the status of the resulting expert system. In closing, we identify the main stages in fielding an applied learning system and draw some lessons from successful applications. Introduction  Machine learning is the study of computational methods for improving performance by mechanizing the acquisition of knowledge from experience. Expert performance requires much domainspecific knowledge, and knowledge engineering has produced hundreds of AI expert systems that are now used regularly in industry. Machine learning aims to provide ...
