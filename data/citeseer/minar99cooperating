Cooperating Mobile Agents for Dynamic Network Routing this paper we present a contrasting model, a dynamic, wireless, peer to peer network with routing tasks performed in a decentralized and distributed fashion by mobile software agents that cooperate to accumulate and distribute connectivity information. Our agents determine system topology by exploring the network, then store this information in the nodes on the network. Other agents use this stored information to derive multi-hop routes across the network. We study these algorithms in simulation as an example of using populations of mobile agents to manage networks
