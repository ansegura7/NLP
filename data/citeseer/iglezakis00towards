Towards the Use of Case Properties for Maintaining Case-Based Reasoning Systems . Because of the importance of maintenance in the realm of case--based reasoning systems, methods of maintaining case bases using case properties will be presented. The necessary notation is given, along with definitions of the properties themselves, which are correctness, consistency, incoherence, minimality, and uniqueness. Use of these properties in five experiments is explained, and the results of these experiments on three real world case bases is given. While the prediction accuracy remains constant the case base size is reduced up to 69.1%. 1 Introduction The maintaining of case--based reasoning systems has become increasingly an important research topic during the last few years. For example, a workshop entitled Flexible Strategies for Maintaining Knowledge Containers [7] held at the 14th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence gave researchers the opportunity to present and discuss new progress in this field. The development of useful and accurate quality measur...
