Reasoning over Conceptual Schemas and Queries in Temporal Databases This paper introduces a new logical formalism,  intended for temporal conceptual modelling,  as a natural combination of the wellknown  description logic DLR and pointbased  linear temporal logic with Since and  Until. The expressive power of the resulting   DLRUS logic is illustrated by providing  a systematic formalisation of the most important  temporal entity-relationship data models  appeared in the literature. We define  a query language (where queries are nonrecursive  Datalog programs and atoms are  complex DLRUS expressions) and investigate  the problem of checking query containment  under the constraints defined by  DLRUS conceptual schemas, as well as the  problems of schema satisfiability and logical  implication. Although it is shown that reasoning  in full DLRUS is undecidable, we  identify the decidable (in a sense, maximal)  fragment DLR  US  by allowing applications  of temporal operators to formulas and entities  only (but not to relation expressions). We obtain  the following hierarchy of complexity results:  (a) reasoning in DLR US with atomic  formulas is EXPTIME-complete, (b) satisfiability  and logical implication of arbitrary  DLR US formulas is EXPSPACE-complete,  and (c) the problem of checking query containment  of non-recursive Datalog queries under   DLR US constraints is decidable in 2EXPTIME.
