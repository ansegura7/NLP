For example, it formalizes that violating commitments  leads to a decrease in trustworthiness.  1 Introduction  In advanced applications of multi-agent systems agents interact more frequently, deliberate more extensively, and in general act more autonomously. For example, in electronic commerce agents are allowed to negotiate ...
