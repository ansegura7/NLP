Automatic Text Detection and Tracking in Digital Video Text which appears in a scene or is graphically added to video can provide an important supplemental source of index information as well as clues for decoding the video's structure and for classification. In this paper we present algorithms for detecting and tracking text in digital video. Our system implements a scalespace feature extractor that feeds an artificial neural processor to detect text blocks. Our text tracking scheme consists of two modules: an SSD (Sum of Squared Difference)-based module to find the initial position and a contour-based module to refine the position. Experiments conducted with a variety of video sources show that our scheme can detect and track text robustly.

Introduction The continued proliferation of large amounts of digital video has increased demand for true content based indexing and retrieval systems. Traditionally, content has been indexed primaril...
