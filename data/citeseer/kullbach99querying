Querying as an Enabling Technology in Software Reengineering In this paper it is argued that different kinds of reengineering technologies can be based on querying. Several reengineering technologies are presented as being integrated into a technically oriented reengineering taxonomy. The usefulness of querying is pointed out with respect to these reengineering technologies.  To impose querying as a base technology in reengineering examples are given with respect to the EER/GRAL approach to conceptual modeling and implementation. This approach is presented together with GReQL as its query part. The different reengineering technologies are finally reviewed in the context of the GReQL query facility.  1 Introduction  Reengineering may be viewed as any activity that either improves the understanding of a software or else improves the software itself [2].  According to this view software reengineering can be "partitioned" into two kinds of activities. The first kind of activities is concerned with understanding such as source code retrieval, browsin...
