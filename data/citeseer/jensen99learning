Learning Quantitative Knowledge for Multiagent Coordination A central challenge of multiagent coordination is reasoning  about how the actions of one agent affect the  actions of another. Knowledge of these interrelationships  can help coordinate agents --- preventing conflicts  and exploiting beneficial relationships among actions.  We explore three interlocking methods that  learn quantitative knowledge of such non-local effects  in TAEMS, a well-developed framework for multiagent  coordination. The surprising simplicity and effectiveness  of these methods demonstrates how agents can  learn domain-specific knowledge quickly, extending the  utility of coordination frameworks that explicitly represent  coordination knowledge.  Introduction  A major challenge of designing effective multiagent systems is managing non-local effects --- situations where the actions of one agent impact the performance of other agents' actions. For example, one agent's action can enable, disable, facilitate, or hinder the actions of other agents. Poor accounting for ...
