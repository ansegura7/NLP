Learning to Detect Salient Objects in Natural Scenes Using Visual Attention In the primate's visual system, selective attention rapidly selects conspicuous image locations to be analyzed in more details. Such selection is guided by several low-level feature extraction mechanisms, which detect candidate salient locations based on their local properties for a given feature type (e.g., intensity, color, orientation or motion). One difficulty which arises is how the information from different modalities should be combined into a single "saliency map" controlling where visual attention should be focused. Here, we quantitatively compare three feature combination strategies (simple summation, learned linear summation, and contents-based non-linear normalization) using three databases of natural color images. 1 Introduction  Bottom-up or saliency-based visual attention allows primates to detect, in real time, nonspecific conspicuous targets from cluttered visual environments. Reproducing such nonspecific target detection capability in artificial systems has important ...
