Latency-dependent fitness in evolutionary multithreaded Web agents The World Wide Web creates opportunities for search systems using adaptive distributed agents. This paper presents a threaded implementation of InfoSpiders, a client-based system that uses an evolving population of intelligent agents to browse the Web at query time. We consider different fitness functions based on network resource consumption and show that taxing agents in proportion to latency results in better efficiency without penalties in the quality of the retrieved documents. The tool is available to the public as a Java applet.
