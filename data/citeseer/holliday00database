Database Replication Using Epidemic Update Due to severe performance penalties associated with synchronous replication, there is an increasing  interest in asynchronous replica management protocols in which database transactions are executed locally,  and the effects of these transactions are incorporated asynchronously on remote database copies.  However, the asynchronous protocols currently in use either do not guarantee consistency and serializability  as needed by transactional semantics or they impose restrictions on placement of data and on which  data objects can be updated. In this paper we investigate an epidemic update protocol that guarantees  consistency and serializability in spite of a write-anywhere capability. We conducted experiments on a detailed  simulation of a distributed, replicated database to evaluate this protocol. Our results establish that  this epidemic approach is indeed a viable alternative to traditional eager update protocols for a distributed  database environment where consistency and full seri...
