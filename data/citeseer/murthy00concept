Concept Network: A Structure for Context Sensitive Document Representation In this paper we propose a directed acyclic graphical structure called concept network  (CNW) for context sensitive document representation for use in information filtering.  Nodes of CNW represent concepts and links represent the relationships between  the concepts. A concept can either be a phrase or a topic of discourse, or a mode of  discourse. An important feature of the CNW based scheme (CNWBS) is context filters  [Murthy and Keerthi, 1999] which are employed on the links of the graph to enable context  sensitive analysis and representation of documents. Context filters are intended to  filter the noise in the inputs of the concepts based on the context of appearance of their  inputs. The CNWBS automatically finds the paragraphs related to all concepts in the  document. It also provides good comprehensibility in representation; allows sharing of  CNW among a group of users; and, reduces the credit-assignment problem during its construction.  This representation scheme is used for...
