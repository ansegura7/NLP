Multimodal Man-Machine Interface for Mission Planning This paper presents a multimodal interface featuring fusion of multiple modalities for natural human-computer interaction. The architecture of the interface and the methods applied are described, and the results of the real-time multimodal fusion are analyzed. The research in progress concerning a mission planning scenario is discussed and other possible future directions are also presented.

More natural communication technologies such as speech, sight and touch, are capable of freeing computer users from the constraints of keyboard and mouse. Although they are not sufficiently advanced to be used individually for robust human-machine communication, they have adequately advanced to serve simul...
