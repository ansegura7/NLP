Spatial Agents Implemented in a Logical Expressible Language In this paper, we present a multi-layered architecture  for spatial and temporal agents. The focus is  laid on the declarativity of the approach, which  makes agent scripts expressive and well understandable.  They can be realized as (constraint) logic  programs. The logical description language is able  to express actions or plans for one and more autonomous  and cooperating agents for the RoboCup  (Simulator League). The system architecture hosts  constraint technology for qualitative spatial reasoning,  but quantitative data is taken into account, too.  The basic (hardware) layer processes the agent's  sensor information. An interface transfers this lowlevel  data into a logical representation. It provides  facilities to access the preprocessed data and supplies  several basic skills. The second layer performs  (qualitative) spatial reasoning. On top of this, the  third layer enables more complex skills such as  passing, offside-detection etc. At last, the fourth  layer establishes acting as a team both by emergent  and explicit cooperation. Logic and deduction provide  a clean means to specify and also to implement  teamwork behavior.  1
