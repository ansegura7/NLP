Prosody Modeling in Concept-to-Speech Generation: Methodological Issues Generation of Intensive Care data), a system that generates multimedia briefings of a patient's status after having a bypass operation (Dalal et al. 1996; McKeown et al. 1997). We first describe information MAGIC generates in the process of producing language, turning next to the corpora we collected. We then provide a description of the more traditional approach to prosody modeling, using machine learning that generalizes over many examples, followed by a description of our memory-based approach. Our results show the memory-based approach yields a better improvement in quality, measured through subjective judgments of output.  2. Information from Language Generation  In the course of producing language, language generators typically produce a variety of intermediate linguistic representations that contain information which potentially could influence prosody. Some of this information is similar to the kind of information used in TTS, such as part-of-speech (POS) tags or syntactic cons...
