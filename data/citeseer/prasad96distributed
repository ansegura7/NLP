Distributed Case-Based Learning Multi-agent systems exploiting case based reasoning techniques have to deal with the problem of retrieving episodes that are themselves distributed across a set of agents. From a Gestalt perspective, a good overall case may not be the one derived from the summation of best subcases. In this paper we deal with issues involved in learning and exploiting the learned knowledge in multiagent case-based systems. Introduction Case Based Reasoning (CBR) has been attracting much attention recently as a paradigm with a wide variety of applications [Kolodner 93]. In this paper, we discuss issues pertaining to cooperative retrieval and composition of a case in which subcases are distributed across different agents in a multi-agent system. A multi-agent system comprises a group of intelligent agents working towards a set of common global goals or separate individual goals that may interact. In such a system, each of the agents may not be individually capable of achieving the global goal and/or ...
