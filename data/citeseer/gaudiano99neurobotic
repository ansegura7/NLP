Neurobotics Lab Research: Learning, Vision and Sonar Recognition with Mobile Robots This article provides an overview of research projects undertaken in the Neurobotics Laboratory at Boston University. We focus on applications of neural networks and other biomimetic techniques in sensory processing, navigation, and other tasks using mobile robots. These applications share some central themes: the inclusion of minimal assumptions about the robots and the environment; cross-validation of modules on a variety of robotics platforms and environments; and real-time operation using real robots.  Keywords: Mobile robots, looming, mobile robots, robot learning, Neural networks, ARTMAP, sensor fusion 1 Introduction  The Neurobotics Laboratory was founded in 1996 with the goal of applying neural networks and other biomimetic techniques to the control and guidance of wheeled mobile robot. Research in the lab covers various problems in the general area of autonomous mobile robotics, with an emphasis on navigation and control using biomimetic algorithms that operate in real-time wi...
