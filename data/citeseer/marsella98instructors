An Instructor's Assistant for Team-Training in Dynamic Multi-agent Virtual Worlds . The training of teams in highly dynamic, multi-agent virtual  worlds places a heavy demand on an instructor. We address the instructor  's problem with the PuppetMaster. The PuppetMaster manages a  network of monitors that report on the activities in the simulation in order  to provide the instructor with an interpretation and situation-speci#c  analysis of student behavior. The approach used to model student teams  is to structure the state space into an abstract situation-based model of  behavior that supports interpretation in the face of missing information  about agent's actions and goals.  1 Introduction  Teams of people operating in highly dynamic, multi-agentenvironments must learn to deal with rapid and unpredictable turns of events. Simulation-based training environments inhabited by synthetic agents can be e#ective in providing realistic but safe settings in which to develop skills these environments require #e.g., #14##. To faithfully capture the unpredictable multi-agent...
