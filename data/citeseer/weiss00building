On Building Flexible Agents . This paper focuses on the challenge of building technical  agents that act exibly in modern computing and information environments.  It is argued that existing agent architectures tend to inherently  limit an agent's exibility because they imply a discrete social and cognitive  behavior space. A generic constraint-centered architectural framework  is proposed that aims at enabling agents to act in a continuous  behavior space and thus to achieve higher exibility.  1 Introduction  Modern computing platforms and information environments are becoming more and more distributed, large, open, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Computers are no longer stand-alone systems, but have become tightly connected both with each other and their users. The increasing technological complexity of such platforms and environments goes together with an increasing complexity of their potential applications. This development has led to a rapidly growing research and application interest in agents as a powerful ...
