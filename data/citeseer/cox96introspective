For instance, a knowledge differentiation goal (Cox & Ram, 1995) is a goal to determine a change in a body of knowledge such that two items are separated conceptually. In contrast, a knowledge reconciliation goal (Cox & Ram, 1995) is one that seeks to merge two items that were mistakenly considered separate entities. Both expansion goals and reconciliation goals may include or spawn a knowledge organization goal (Ram, 1993) that seeks to reorganize the existing knowledge so that it is made available to the reasoner at the appropriate time, as well as modify the structure or content of a concept itself. Such reorganization of knowledge affects the conditions under which a particular piece of knowledge is retrieved or the kinds of indexes associated with an item in memory.
