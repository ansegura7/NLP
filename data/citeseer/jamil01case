A Case for Parameterized Views and Relational Unification In this paper, we address the issue of remedying the scepter of impedance mismatch in object-relational SQL. Our approach makes it possible to remain within the current connes of relational models, yet oers the capability of dening methods by SQL's declarative means, thereby preserving all opportunities of query optimization to the fullest extent. We propose the idea of parameterized views and an extension of SQL's create view construct with an optional with parameter clause. Parameterizing enables traditional SQL views to accept input values and delay the computation of the view until invoked with a call statement. This extension empowers users with the capability of modifying the behavior of predened procedures (views) by sending arguments and evaluating the procedure on demand.  Keywords: parameterized views, declarative methods, objectrelational databases, inheritance and overriding, reasoning, unication.  1 Introduction  An outstanding issue in object-relational databases dem...
