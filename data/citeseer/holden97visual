Visual Recognition of Hand Motion Hand gesture recognition is an active area of research in recent years, being used in various applications from deaf sign recognition systems to humanmachine interaction applications. The gesture recognition process, in general, may be divided into two stages: the motion sensing, which extracts useful data from hand motion; and the classification process, which classifies the motion sensing data as gestures. The existing vision-based gesture recognition systems extract 2-D shape and trajectory descriptors from the visual input, and classify them using various classification techniques from maximum likelihood estimation to neural networks, finite state machines, Fuzzy Associative Memory (FAM) or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). This thesis presents the framework of the vision-based Hand Motion Understanding (HMU) system that recognises static and dynamic Australian Sign Language (Auslan) signs by extracting and classifying 3-D hand configuration data from the visual input. The HMU system is...
