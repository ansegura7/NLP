Control States and Motivated Agency One of the challenges faced by researchers in the behaviour modelling of life-like  characters is the need to develop a systematic framework in which to ask  questions about the types of internal state life-like characters might possess, and  how those different states interact. We propose a solution based on a cognitively  inspired multi-layered agent architecture (composed of reactive, deliberative and  meta-management layers), and a recursive "design-based" research methodology  -- wherein each new design gradually increases our explanatory power and allows  us to account for more and more of the phenomena of interest. By describing a  variety of "broad but shallow" complete agents at the information-level, and  showing how these designs realise mental states and processes, we aim to provide  a rich and deep explanatory framework from which to explore motivated  autonomous agency. Early experiments have concentrated on: (a) the  requirements of goal-processing; (b) the emergence of ...
