Embedding Robots into the Internet With the explosive growth of embedded computing hardware it is possible to conceive many new networked robotic applications for diverse domains ranging from urban search and rescue to house cleaning. Designing reliable software for such systems is a challenging problem. However, communication can facilitate robotics by reducing uncertainty, and robotics can facilitate communication by providing physical mobility. In this article we focus on methods for control and coordination of embedded mobile systems (robots) which interact with other computers on a wireless network situated in human environments.  1 Introduction  Ubiquitous embedded computing [12] is here to stay. Information appliances, laptops, palmtops, and wearable computers are examples of the first wave of this new era. Two factors have contributed to the phenomenal increase in the number of computers in our environment: Moore's law and improved network connectivity. It is now increasingly accepted that appliances of the futu...
