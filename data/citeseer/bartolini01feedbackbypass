FeedbackBypass: A New Approach to Interactive Similarity Query Processing In recent years, several methods have been  proposed for implementing interactive similarity  queries on multimedia databases. Common to all  these methods is the idea to exploit user feedback  in order to progressively adjust the query parameters  and to eventually converge to an "optimal" parameter  setting. However, all these methods also  share the drawback to "forget" user preferences  across multiple query sessions, thus requiring the  feedback loop to be restarted for every new query,  i.e. using default parameter values. Not only is  this proceeding frustrating from the user's point  of view but it also constitutes a significant waste  of system resources.  In this paper we present FeedbackBypass, a new  approach to interactive similarity query processing.  It complements the role of relevance feedback  engines by storing and maintaining the query  parameters determined with feedback loops over  time, using a wavelet-based data structure (the  Simplex Tree). For each query, a favorable set of  query parameters can be determined and used to  either "bypass" the feedback loop completely for  already-seen queries, or to start the search process  from a near-optimal configuration.  FeedbackBypass can be combined well with  all state-of-the-art relevance feedback techniques  working in high-dimensional vector spaces. Its  storage requirements scale linearly with the dimensionality  of the query space, thus making even  sophisticated query spaces amenable.
