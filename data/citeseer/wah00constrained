Constrained Genetic Algorithms and their Applications in Nonlinear Constrained Optimization This chapter presents a framework that unifies various search mechanisms for solving constrained nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. These problems are characterized by functions that are not necessarily differentiable and continuous. Our proposed framework is based on the first-order necessary and sufficient condition developed for constrained local minimization in discrete space that shows the equivalence between discrete-neighborhood saddle points and constrained local minima. To look for discrete-neighborhood saddle points, we formulate a discrete constrained NLP in an augmented Lagrangian function and study various mechanisms for performing ascents of the augmented function in the original-variable subspace and descents in the Lagrange-multiplier subspace. Our results show that CSAGA, a combined constrained simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, performs well when using crossovers, mutations, and annealing to generate trial points. Finally, we apply iterative deepening to de...
