Toward Learning Based Web Query Processing In this paper, we describe a novel Web query processing approach with learning capabilities. Under this approach, user queries are in the form of keywords and search engines are employed to find URLs of Web sites that might contain the required information. The first few URLs are presented to the user for browsing. Meanwhile, the query processor learns both the information required by the user and the way that the user navigates through hyperlinks to locate such information. With the learned knowledge, it processes the rest URLs and produces precise query results in the form of segments of Web pages without user involvement. The preliminary experimental results indicate that the approach can process a range of Web queries with satisfactory performance. The architecture of such a query processor, techniques of modeling HTML pages, and knowledge for query processing are discussed. Experiments on the effectiveness of the approach, the required knowledge, and the training strategies are presented.
