RoboCup Rescue: Search and Rescue in Large-Scale Disasters as a Domain for Autonomous Agents Research Disaster rescue is one of the most serious social issue which involves very large numbers of hetergenious agents in the hostile environment. RoboCup-Rescue intends to promote research and development in this socially significant domain by creating a standard simulator and forum for researchers and practitioners. While the rescue domain intuitively appealing as large scale multi-agent domains, it has not yet given through analysis on its domain characteristics. In this paper, we present detailed analysis on the task domain and elucidate characteristics necessary for multi-agent systems for this domain.  1 Introduction  In this paper, we propose RoboCup-Rescue, as a secondary domain for RoboCup activities [ Kitano, et al., 1997]. The aim of RoboCup-Rescue are (1) to ensure smooth transfer of technologies invented through RoboCup activity to a socially significant real world domain, (2) to establish a domain which complements features that are missing in soccer, and (3) to examine funderm...
