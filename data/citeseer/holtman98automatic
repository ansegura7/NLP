Automatic Reclustering of Objects in Very Large Databases for High Energy Physics In the very large object database systems planned for some future particle physics experiments, typical physics analysis jobs will traverse millions of read-only objects, many more objects than fit in the database cache. Thus, a good clustering of objects on disk is highly critical to database performance. We present the implementation and performance measurements of a prototype reclustering mechanism which was developed to optimise I/O performance under the changing access patterns in a high energy physics database. Reclustering is done automatically and on-line. The methods used by our prototype differ greatly from those commonly found in proposed general-purpose reclustering systems. By exploiting some special characteristics of the access patterns of physics analysis jobs, the prototype manages to keep database I/O throughput close to the optimum throughput of raw sequential disk access.
