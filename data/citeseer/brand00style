Style Machines We approach the problem of stylistic motion synthesis by learning motion patterns from  a highly varied set of motion capture sequences. Each sequence may have a distinct  choreography, performed in a distinct style. Learning identifies common choreographic  elements across sequences, the different styles in which each element is performed, and  a small number of stylistic degrees of freedom which span the many variations in the  dataset. The learned model can synthesize novel motion data in any interpolation or  extrapolation of styles. For example, it can convert novice ballet motions into the more  graceful modern dance of an expert. The model can also be driven by video, by scripts,  or even by noise to generate new choreography and synthesize virtual motion-capture  in many styles.
