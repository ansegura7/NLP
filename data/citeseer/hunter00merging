Merging Potentially Inconsistent Items of Structured Text Structured text is a general concept that is implicit in a variety of approaches to handling  information. Syntactically, an item of structured text is a number of grammatically simple  phrases together with a semantic label for each phrase. Items of structured text may be nested  within larger items of structured text. The semantic labels in a structured text are meant to  parameterize a stereotypical situation, and so a particular item of structured text is an instance  of that stereotypical situation. Much information is potentially available as structured text  including tagged text in XML, text in relational and object-oriented databases, and the output  from information extraction systems in the form of instantiated templates. In this paper, we  formalize the concept of structured text, and then focus on how we can identify inconsistency  in the logical representation of items of structured text. We then present a new framework  for merging logical theories that can be employed t...
