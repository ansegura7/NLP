Future Multimedia User Interfaces this article, we examine some of the work that has been done in these two fields and explore where they are heading. First, we review their often-confusing terminology and provide a brief historical overview. Since both fields rely largely on relatively unusual, and largely immature, hardware technologies, we next provide a high-level introduction to important hardware issues. This is followed by a description of the key approaches to system architecture used by current researchers. We then build on the background provided by these sections to lay out a set of current research issues and directions for future work. Throughout, we attempt to emphasize the many ways in which virtual environments and ubiquitous computing can complement each other, creating an exciting new form of multimedia computing that is far more powerful than either approach would make possible alone.
