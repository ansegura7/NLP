Searching the World Wide Web in Low-Connectivity Communities The Internet has the potential to deliver information to communities around the world that have no other information resources. High telephone and ISP fees- in combination with lowbandwidth connections- make it unaffordable for many people to browse the Web online. We are developing the TEK system to enable users to search the Web using only email. TEK stands for &quot;Time Equals Knowledge, &quot; since the user exchanges time (waiting for email) for knowledge. The system contains three components: 1) the client, which provides a graphical interface for the end user, 2) the server, which performs the searches from MIT, and 3) a reliable email-based communication protocol between the client and the server. The TEK search engine differs from others in that it is designed to return low-bandwidth results, which are achieved by special filtering, analysis, and compression on the server side. We believe that TEK will bring Web resources to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them.
