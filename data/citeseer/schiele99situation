Situation Aware Computing with Wearable Computers 1 Motivation for contextual aware computing: For most computer systems, even virtual reality systems, sensing techniques are a means of getting input directly from the user. However, wearable sensors and computers offer a unique opportunity to re-direct sensing technology towards recovering more general user context. Wearable computers have the potential to "see" as the user sees, "hear" as the user hears, and experience the life of the user in a "first-person" sense. This increase in contextual and user information may lead to more intelligent and fluid interfaces that use the physical world as part of the interface. Wearable computers are excellent platforms for contextually aware applications, but these applications are also necessary to use wearables to their fullest. Wearables are more than just highly portable computers, they perform useful work even while the wearer isn't directly interacting with the system. In such environments the user needs to concentrate on his environment, not on the computer interface, so the wearable needs to use information from the wearer's context to be the least distracting. For example, imagine an interface which is aware of the user's location: while being in the subway, the system might alert him with a
