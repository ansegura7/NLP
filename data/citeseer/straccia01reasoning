Reasoning within Fuzzy Description Logics Description Logics (DLs) are suitable, well-known, logics for managing structured knowledge. They allow reasoning about individuals and well defined concepts, i.e. set of individuals with co#hfiP pro# erties. The experience in using DLs inapplicatio#& has sho wn that in many cases we wo#6H like to extend their capabilities. In particular, their use in the co# texto# Multimedia Info#mediafi Retrieval (MIR) leadsto the co# vincement that such DLssho#PF allo w the treatmento f the inherentimprecisio# in multimediao# ject co# tent representatio# and retrieval.
