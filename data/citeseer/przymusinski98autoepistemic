Autoepistemic Logic of Knowledge and Beliefs In recent years, various formalizations of non-monotonic reasoning and different semantics for normal and disjunctive logic programs have been proposed, including autoepistemic logic, circumscription, CWA, GCWA, ECWA, epistemic specifications, stable, well-founded, stationary and static semantics of normal and disjunctive logic programs. In this paper we introduce a simple non-monotonic knowledge representation framework which isomorphically contains all of the above mentioned non-monotonic formalisms and semantics as special cases and yet is significantly more expressive than each one of these formalisms considered individually. The new formalism, called the Autoepistemic Logic of Knowledge and Beliefs, AELB, is obtained by augmenting Moore's autoepistemic logic, AEL, already employing the knowledge operator , L, with an additional belief operator , B. As a result, we are able to reason not only about formulae F which are known to be true (i.e., those for which LF holds) but also abou...
