TIC - A Toolkit for Validation in Formal Language Learning Quite often, heuristics and common sense suggest  directions for improving well--known learning algorithms.  However it seems not an easy task to verify  that the modifications are indeed helpful.  This is made more complicated through various additional  influences inherent in different application domains.  In order to obtain a faithful impression of phenomena  that are intrinsic to the algorithms, the role  of specific domains should be minimized.  Our validation toolkit TIC allows to explore the behaviour  of various algorithms for learning formal languages.  This is a well-examined and standardized application  domain.  TIC is operated by interactive as well as automatic  control.  Motivation and Introduction  Today, a lot of different learning approaches and algorithms do exist. There are "classical" as well as "brand new" approaches, and all of them come in many versions and refinements. On the one hand this indicates a desirable improvement of methods, but on the other hand it ...
