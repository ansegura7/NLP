Argument in Multi-Agent Systems Multi-agent systems research is concerned both with the modelling of human and animal societies and with the development of principles for the design of practical distributed information management systems. This position paper will, rather than examine the various dierences in perspective within this area of research, discuss issues of communication and commitment that are of interest to multi-agent systems research in general. 1 Introduction A computational society is a collection of autonomous agents that are loosely dependent upon each other. The intentional stance [12] is often taken in describing the state of these agents. An agent may have beliefs, desires, intentions, and it may adopt a role or have relationships with others. Thus, multi-agent systems (MAS) as with most AI research is signi cantly inuenced, at least in its vocabulary, by philosophy and cognitive psychology. 1 So, what's the point? Computational societies are developed for two primary reasons:  Mode...
