Rapid Concurrent Software Engineering in Competitive Situations This article is an experience report on the evolutionary development process of AT Humboldt, a multi agent system which has become World Champion 1997 and Vice World Champion 1998 of RoboCup simulator league. It details why the artifical soccer initiative RoboCup is a tempting domain for rapid concurrent software engineering. Both the development processes in 1997 and 1998 are described, compared and evaluated. Lessons learned for development projects in distributed control conclude this report. 1 Introduction  In this article the project managers describe the evolutionary development process of the software project AT (AgentTeam) Humboldt, which has become World Champion 1997 and Vice World Champion 1998 in the simulator league of the artifical soccer contest RoboCup ([10]). The RoboCup initiative recently gets more and more popular among scientists in robotics, distributed systems and distributed artificial intelligence because of its strong competitive character and tight resource b...
