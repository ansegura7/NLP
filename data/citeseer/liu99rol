ROL2: Towards a Real Deductive Object-Oriented Database Language ROL is a strongly typed deductive object-oriented database language. It integrates  many important features of deductive databases and object-oriented databases. However,  it is only a structurally object-oriented language. In this paper, we present our  extension of ROL called ROL2. Most importantly, ROL2 supports behaviorally objectoriented  features such as rule-based methods and encapsulation so that it is a now real  deductive object-oriented database language. It supports in a rule-based framework  nearly all important object-oriented features such as object identity, complex objects,  typing, information hiding, rule-based methods, encapsulation of such methods, overloading,  late binding, polymorphism, class hierarchies, multiple structural and behavioral  inheritance with overriding, blocking, and conict handling. It is so far the only  deductive system that supports all these features in a pure rule-based framework.  Keywords: object-oriented databases, deductive databases, ...
