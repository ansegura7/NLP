Analysis and Design of Multiagent Systems Using Hybrid Coordination Media Over the last few years, two advances in agent-oriented  software engineering have had a significant impact. The first is  the identification of interaction and coordination as the central  focus of multiagent systems design and the second is the   realization that the multiagent organization is distinct from the  individual agents that populate the system. Also, the evolution  of new, more powerful hybrid coordination models, which  combine data-centered and control-centered coordination  approaches, have given us the capability to model and  implement the rules that govern organizations independently   from the individual agents in the system. This paper  investigates how to combine the power of these hybrid  coordination capabilities with the concept of organizational   rules using traditional conversation-based approaches to  designing multiagent systems.   1.
