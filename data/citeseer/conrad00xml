XML Conceptual Modeling using UML . The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is increasingly finding  acceptance as a standard for storing and exchanging structured and  semi-structured information. With its expressive power, XML enables a  great variety of applications relying on such structures - notably product  catalogs, digital libraries, and electronic data interchange (EDI). As  the data schema, an XML Document Type Definition (DTD) is a means  by which documents and objects can be structured. Currently, there is  no suitable way to model DTDs conceptually. Our approach is to model  DTDs and thus classes of documents on the basis of UML (Unified Modeling  Language). We consider UML to be the connecting link between  software engineering and document design, i.e., it is possible to design  object-oriented software together with the necessary XML structures. For  this reason, we describe how to transform the static part of UML, i.e.  class diagrams, into XML DTDs. The major challenge for the transformation  is to defi...
