A Unifying Approach to HTML Wrapper Representation and Learning . The number, the size, and the dynamics of Internet information  sources bears abundant evidence of the need for automation in information  extraction. This calls for representation formalisms that match  the World Wide Web reality and for learning approaches and learnability  results that apply to these formalisms.  The concept of elementary formal systems is appropriately generalized to  allow for the representation of wrapper classes which are relevant to the  description of Internet sources in HTML format. Related learning results  prove that those wrappers are automatically learnable from examples.  This is setting the stage for information extraction from the Internet by  exploitation of inductive learning techniques.  1 Motivation  Today's online access to millions or even billions of documents in the World Wide Web is a great challenge to research areas related to knowledge discovery and information extraction (IE). The general task of IE is to locate specific pieces of text i...
