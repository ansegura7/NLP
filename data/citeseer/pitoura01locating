Locating Objects in Mobile Computing In current distributed systems, the notion of mobility is emerging in many forms and applications.  Mobility arises naturally in wireless computing, since the location of users changes as  they move. Besides mobility in wireless computing, software mobile agents are another popular  form of moving objects. Locating objects, i.e., identifying their current location, is central to  mobile computing. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the various approaches  to the problem of storing, querying, and updating the location of objects in mobile computing.  The fundamental techniques underlying the proposed approaches are identified, analyzed and  classified along various dimensions.  Keywords: mobile computing, location management, location databases, caching, replication,  moving objects, spatio-temporal databases  1 Introduction  In current distributed systems, the notion of mobility is emerging in many forms and applications. Increasingly many users are not tied to a fixed...
