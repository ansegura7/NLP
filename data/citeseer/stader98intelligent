Intelligent Support for Enterprise Modelling Enterprise modelling- integrating models of all pertinent aspects of an enterprise- is essential to the management of change in organisations. An integrated view of an organisation provides insight into what aspects may bechanged, how they may be changed, and what the overall e ect of speci c changes will be. AIAI at the University ofEdinburgh has an ongoing research programme which focuses on the use AI techniques to cover the requirements of enterprise modelling and the tools to support it. The AI techniques used in AIAI's programme range from knowledge representation, ontologies and process modelling techniques to visualisation techniques, intelligent work ow and coordination technology. The techniques are combined in an integrated toolset delivered on an agent-based architecture. Part of AIAI's programme is the Enterprise project which has been instrumental in determining the requirements for enterprise modelling and in the development ofan integrated toolset to support it. The results of the Enterprise project show thatwhen combined with task management support, enterprise models may directly control the operation of an organisation. Based on the results of the Enterprise project, AIAI's TBPM project currently addresses coordination issues of enterprise modelling support. In this paper, we rst describe the requirements for enterprise modelling and enactment in general. We then discuss the Enterprise Toolset which was designed and was implemented to address these requirements. Finally, weevaluate the toolset and describe extensions that are currently being undertaken. AIAI-TR-220/0.1 Page 1 1
