Social and Semiotic Analyses for Theorem Prover User Interface Design : We describe an approach to user interface design based on ideas from cognitive science, social science, especially the theory of stories, and a new area tentatively called algebraic semiotics. Social analysis helps to identify coherent classes of users and their requirements, and suggests some ways to make proofs more understandable, while algebraic semiotics, which combines semiotics with algebraic specification, provides a rigorous theory of interface functionality and quality. We apply these techniques to designing user interfaces for a distributed cooperative theorem proving system, whose main component is a website generation and proof assistance tool called Kumo. This interface integrates formal proving, proof browsing, animation, informal explanation, and online background tutorials. Experience with using the interface is reported, and some conclusions are drawn. 1 Introduction  Recent large advances in performance have made it arguable that the most pressing open problems in ...
