On Representation and Approximation of Operations in Boolean Algebras Several universal approximation and universal representation results  are known for non-Boolean multi-valued logics such as fuzzy logics. In  this paper, we show that similar results can be proven for multi-valued  Boolean logics as well.  Introduction. The study of Boolean algebras started when G. Boole [1] considered the simplest Boolean algebra -- the two-valued algebra B (2) = f0; 1g (=ffalse,trueg). In this algebra, the operation  ([),  ("), and negation a  0 (:a) have the direct logical meaning of "or", "and", and "not". It is known that in this Boolean algebra, an arbitrary operation, i.e., an arbitrary function B \Theta : : : \Theta B ! B, can be represented as a superposition of these three basic logical operations: e.g., the implication a ! b can be represented as b :a, etc. Logic is still one of the area of application of Boolean algebras, but, starting from the classical Kolmogorov's monograph [4], Boolean algebras -- namely, algebras of events -- became an important tool i...
