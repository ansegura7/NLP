Process- and Agent-Based Modelling Techniques for Dialogue Systems and Virtual Environments This text presents results of ongoing research, which is aimed at developing a framework for developing multimodal natural language dialogue systems operating within virtual environments. The aspects of multimodality and presence in a virtual environment are chosen as the main focus of this research. It may be argued that specification techniques would form the basis of such a framework. Therefore, a general overview and evaluation is given of existing specification techniques for interactive systems, based on both literature and previous research results. This includes the object-oriented model, process algebras, interactor models, and agent systems. Agent systems are further subdivided into intentional logics, production rule systems, agent communication languages, agent platforms, and agent architectures. A new agent system is proposed, which is based on update notification mechanisms as found in interactor models, and the `facilitator' function as found in some agent platfo...
