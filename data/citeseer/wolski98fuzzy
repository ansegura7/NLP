Fuzzy Triggers: Incorporating Imprecise Reasoning into Active Databases Traditional Event-Condition-Action triggers (active database rules) include a Boolean predicate as a trigger condition. We propose fuzzy triggers whereby fuzzy inference is utilized in the condition evaluation. This way, approximate reasoning may be integrated with a traditional crisp database. The new approach paves the way for intuitive expression of application semantics of imprecise nature, in database-bound applications. Two fuzzy triggers models are proposed. Firstly, a set of fuzzy rules is encapsulated into a Boolean-valued function called a rule set function, leading to the C-fuzzy trigger model. Subsequently, actions are expressed also in fuzzy terms, and the corresponding CA-fuzzy trigger model is proposed. Examples are provided to illustrate how fuzzy triggers can be applied to a real-life drive control system in an industrial installation.  1 . Introduction  There has been considerable interest in active database rules (called triggers in commercial applications, and in th...
