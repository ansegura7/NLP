Genetic and Evolutionary Algorithms in the Real World Introduction  Since 1992, I have made regular trips to Japan to give talks about genetic algorithms (GAs)---search procedures based on the mechanics of natural selection and genetics. Back during my first visit, the use of genetic and evolutionary algorithms (GEAs) was restricted to a relatively small cadre of devoted specialists. Today, Japanese researchers and practitioners are ably advancing the state of GEA art and application across a broad front. Around the globe, from traditional and cutting-edge optimization in engineering and operations research to such non-traditional areas as drug design, financial prediction, data mining, and the composition of poetry and music, GEAs are grabbing attention and solving problems across a broad spectrum of human endeavor. Of course, science and technology go through fads and fashions much like those of apparel, food, and toys, and many practitioners---in Japan and elsewhere---are wondering whether GEAs, like so many methods that have c
