Designing Agent-Oriented Systems by Analysing Agent Interactions . We propose a preliminary methodology for agent-oriented software  engineering based on the idea of agent interaction analysis. This approach uses  interactions between undetermined agents as the primary component of analysis  and design. Agents as a basis for software engineering are useful because they  provide a powerful and intuitive abstraction which can increase the comprehensiblity  of a complex design. The paper describes a process by which the designer  can derive the interactions that can occur in a system satisfying the given requirements  and use them to design the structure of an agent-based system, including  the identification of the agents themselves. We suggest that this approach has the  flexibility necessary to provide agent-oriented designs for open and complex applications,  and has value for future maintenance and extension of these systems.  1
