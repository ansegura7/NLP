A Machine Learning Researcher's Foray into Recidivism Prediction We discuss an application of machine learning to recidivism prediction. Our initial results motivate the  need for a methodology for technique selection for applications that involve unequal but unknown error  costs, a skewed data set, or both. Evaluation methodologies traditionally used in machine learning are  inadequate for analyzing performance in these situations, although they arise frequently when addressing  real-world problems. After discussing the problem of recidivism prediction and the particulars of our  data set, we present experimental results that motivate the need to evaluate learning algorithm over a  range of error costs. We then describe Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, which has been  used extensively in signal detection theory for decades but has only recently begun to filter into machine  learning research. With this new perspective, we revisit the recidivism prediction task and present results  that contradict those obtained using a traditional ...
