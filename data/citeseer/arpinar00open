An Open Electronic Marketplace through Agent-based Workflows: MOPPET We propose an electronic marketplace architecture, called MOPPET, where the commerce processes in the marketplace are modeled as adaptable agent-based workflows. The higher level of abstraction provided by the workflow technology makes the customization of electronic commerce processes for different users possible. Agent-based implementation, on the other hand, provides for a highly reusable component-based workflow architecture as well as negotiation ability and the capability to adapt to dynamic changes in the environment. Agent communication is handled through Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML). A workflow-based architecture also makes it possible for complete modeling of electronic commerce processes by allowing involved parties to be able to invoke already existing applications or to define new tasks and to restructure the control and data flow among the tasks to create custom built process definitions. In the proposed architecture all data exchanges are realized through Extensible Markup Language (XML) providing uniformity, simplicity and a highly open and interoperable architecture. Metadata of activities are expressed through Resource Description Framework (RDF). Common Business Library (CBL) is used for achieving interoperability across business domains and domain specific Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are used for vertical industries. We provide our own specifications for missing DTDs to be replaced by the original specifications when they become available.
