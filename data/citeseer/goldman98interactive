Interactive Query and Search in Semistructured Databases Semistructured graph-based databases have been proposed as well-suited stores for World-Wide Web data. Yet so far, languages for querying such data are too complex for casual Web users. Further, proposed query approaches do not take advantage of the interactivity of typical Web sessions---users are proficient at iteratively refining their Web explorations. In this paper we propose a new model for interactively querying and searching semistructured databases. Users can begin with a simple keyword search, dynamically browse the structure of the result, and then submit further refining queries. Enabling this model exposes new requirements of a semistructured database that are not apparent under traditional database uses. We demonstrate the importance of efficient keyword search, structural summaries of query results, and support for inverse pointers. We also describe some preliminary solutions to these technical issues. 1 Introduction Querying the Web has understandably gathered much att...
