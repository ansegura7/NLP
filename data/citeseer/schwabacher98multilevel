Multilevel Simulation and Numerical Optimization of Complex Engineering Designs Multilevel representations have been studied extensively by artificial intelligence researchers. We present a general method that utilizes the multilevel paradigm to attack the problem of performing multidiscipline engineering design optimization in the presence of many local optima. The method uses a multidisciplinary simulator at multiple levels of abstraction, paired with a multilevel search space. We tested the method in the domain of conceptual design of supersonic transport aircraft, focusing on the airframe and the exhaust nozzle, and using sequential quadratic programming as the optimizer at each level. We found that using multilevel simulation and optimization can decrease the cost of design space search by an order of magnitude. 1 Introduction  A major barrier to the use of gradient-based search methods for engineering design is that complex, multidisciplinary design spaces tend    An earlier version of this article was presented at 6  th  AIAA/NASA/USAF Multidisciplinary Ana...
