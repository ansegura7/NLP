Eyes in the Interface Computer vision has a significant role to play in the human-computer interaction (HCI) devices of the future. All computer input devices serve one essential purpose. They transduce some motion or energy from a human agent into machine useable signals. One may therefore think of input devices as the `perceptual organs' by which computers sense the intents of their human users. We outline the role computer vision will play, highlight the impediments to the development of vision-based interfaces, and propose an approach for overcoming these impediments. Prospective vision research areas for HCI include human face recognition, facial expression interpretation, lip reading, head orientation detection, eye gaze tracking, three-dimensional finger pointing, hand tracking, hand gesture interpretation, and body pose tracking. For vision-based interfaces to make any impact, we will have to embark on an expansive approach which begins with the study of the interaction modality we seek to implement...
