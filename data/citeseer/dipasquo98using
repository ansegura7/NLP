Using HTML Formatting to Aid in Natural Language Processing on the World Wide Web Because of its magnitude and the fact that it is not computer understandable, the World Wide Web has become a prime candidate for automatic natural language tasks. This thesis argues that there is information in the layout of a web page, and that by looking at the HTML formatting in addition to the text on a page, one can improve performance in tasks such as learning to classify segments of documents. A rich representation for web pages, the HTML Struct Tree, is described. A parsing algorithm for creating Struct Trees is presented, as well as a set of experiments that use Struct Trees as a feature set for learning to extract a company's name and location from its Web pages. Through these experiments we found that it is useful to consider the layout of a page for these tasks.  Contents 1. Acknowledgements 2 2. Motivations 3 3. Related Work 3 4. HTML Struct Trees 4  4.1.
