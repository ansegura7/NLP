A Methodology to Improve Ad Hoc Data-Driven Linguistic Rule Learning Methods by Inducing Cooperation Among Rules Within the Linguistic Modeling eld |one of the most important applications of Fuzzy  Rule-Based Systems|, a family of ecient and simple methods guided by covering criteria  of the data in the example set, called \ad hoc data-driven methods", has been proposed in the  literature in the last few years. Their high performance, in addition to their quickness and  easy understanding, have make them very suitable for learning tasks. In this paper we are  going to perform a double task analyzing these kinds of learning methods and introducing  a new methodology to signicantly improve their accuracy keeping their descriptive power  unalterable.  On the one hand, a taxonomy of ad hoc data-driven learning methods based on the way  in which the available data is used to guide the learning will be made. In this sense, we  will distinguish between two approaches: the example-based and the fuzzy-grid-based one.  Whilst in the former each rule is obtained from a specic example, in the latter the e...
