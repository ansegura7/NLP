Evolutionary Approaches to Off-Line Routing in Backbone Communications Networks Off-line routing in backbone communications networks is an important combinatorial optimisation problem. It has three main uses: first, off-line routing provides reference benchmark results for dynamic (on-line) routing strategies. Second, and more interestingly, off-line routing is becoming more and more investigated and employed in its own right as a way of quickly finding significantly improved routings for live networks which can then be imposed on the network to offer a net improvement in quality of service. Third, it can be used in networks where bandwidth may be booked in advance. In this paper we introduce and investigate a number of heuristic techniques applicable to the routing problem for use in stochastic, iterative search. Results are presented which indicate that these heuristics significantly improve the search for solutions, particularly when on-line performance is considered. We also investigate how computation time can be further reduced by the use of delta-evaluation...
