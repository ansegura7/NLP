Revisiting Rationality for Agents With Intentions Formal frameworks for the specification of autonomous agents are commonly based on logics of intention and belief. Desirable properties for logics of intention are particularly non-standard, even more so than for logics of belief. In this paper, we address problems with existing logics of intention and belief by shifting to a non-classical semantics, making use of Rantala's impossible, or non-normal, worlds. Our framework invalidates the problematic properties of intention and, by imposing certain constraints on the algebraic structure of the models, we show that that many desirable properties can be obtained. The non-normal worlds framework provides a fine-grained semantics and proves to be an extremely powerful and flexible tool for the logical specification of rational agent behaviour. 1. Introduction  Logics of Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI ) have recently received much attention in the AI literature on the design of autonomous intelligent agents (e.g. [2, 3, 6]). The importanc...
