Fjording the Stream: An Architecture for Queries over Streaming Sensor Data If  industry  visionaries are correct, our lives will soon be full of sensors, connected together in loose conglomerations via wireless networks, each monitoring and collecting data about the environment at large. These sensors behave  very differently  from traditional database sources:  they  have intermittent connectivity  , are limited  by  severe power constraints, and  ty pically  sample  periodically  and push immediately , keeping no record of historical information. These limitations make traditional database sy tems inappropriate for queries over sensors. We present the Fjords architecture for managing multiple queries over  many  sensors, and show how it can be used to limit sensor resource demands while maintaining high  query  throughput. We evaluate our architecture using traces from a network of traffic sensors deployM on Interstate 80 near  Berkeley  and present performance results that show how  query  throughput, communication costs, and power consumption are  necessarily  coupled in sensor environments.
