Performance and Memory-Access Characterization of Data Mining Applications This paper characterizes the performance and memoryaccess behavior of a decision tree induction program, a previously unstudied application used in data mining and knowledge discovery in databases. Performance is studied via RSIM, an execution driven simulator, for three uniprocessor models that exploit Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) to varying degrees. Several properties of the program are noted. Outof -order dispatch and multiple-issue provide a significant performance advantage: 50%--250% improvement in IPC for out-of-order versus in-order, and 5%--120% improvement in IPC for four-way issue versus singleissue. Multiple-issue provides a greater performance improvement for larger L2 cache sizes, when the program is limited by CPU performance; out-of-order dispatch provides a greater performance improvement for smaller L2 cache sizes. The program has a very small instruction footprint: an 8-kB L1 instruction cache is sufficient to bring the instruction miss rate below 0.1%. A smal...
