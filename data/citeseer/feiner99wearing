Wearing It Out: First Steps Toward Mobile Augmented Reality Systems Introduction  Over the past decade, there has been a ground swell of activityintwo #elds of user interface research: augmented reality and wearable computing. Augmentedreality #1# refers to the creation of virtual environments that supplement, rather than replace, the real world with additional information. This is accomplished through the use of #see-through" displays that enrich the user's view of the world byoverlaying visual, auditory, and even haptic, material on what she experiences. Visual augmented reality systems typically, but not exclusively, employ head-tracked, head-worn displays. These either use half-silvered mirror beam splitters to re#ect small computer displays, optically combining them with a view of the real world, or use opaque displays fed by electronics that merge imagery captured by head-worn cameras with synthesized graphics. Wearable computing moves computers o# the desktop and onto the user's body, made possible through the
