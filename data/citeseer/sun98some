Some Experiments with a Hybrid Model for Learning Sequential Decision Making To deal with sequential decision tasks, we present a learning model Clarion, which is a hybrid connectionist model consisting of both localist and distributed representations, based on the two-level approach proposed in Sun (1995). The model learns and utilizes procedural and declarative knowledge, tapping into the synergy of the two types of processes. It unifies neural, reinforcement, and symbolic methods to perform on-line, bottom-up learning. Experiments in various situations are reported that shed light on the working of the model. 1 Introduction  This paper presents a hybrid model that unifies neural, symbolic, and reinforcement learning into an integrated architecture. It addresses the following three issues: (1) It deals with concurrent on-line learning: It allows a situated agent to learn continuously from on-going experience in the world, without the use of preconstructed data sets or preconceived concepts. (2) The model learns not only low-level procedural skills but also hi...
