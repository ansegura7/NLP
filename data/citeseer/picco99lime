LIME: Linda Meets Mobility Lime is a system designed to assist in the rapid development of dependable mobile applications over both wired and ad hoc networks. Mobile agents reside on mobile hosts and all communication takes place via transiently shared tuple spaces distributed across the mobile hosts. The decoupled style of computing characterizing the Linda model is extended to the mobile environment. At the application level, both agents and hosts perceive movement as a sudden change of context. The set of tuples accessible by a particular agent residing on a given host is altered transparently in response to changes in the connectivity pattern among the mobile hosts. In this paper we present the key design concepts behind the Lime system. 1 INTRODUCTION Today's users demand ubiquitous network access independent of their physical location. This style of computation, often referred to as mobile computing, is enabled by rapid advances in the wireless communication technology. The networking scenarios enabled ...
