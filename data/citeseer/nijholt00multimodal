Multimodal Interactions with Agents in Virtual Worlds Introduction  World Wide Web allows interactions and transactions through Web pages using speech and language, either by inanimate or live agents, image interpretation and generation, and, of course the more traditional ways of presenting explicitly predefined information of text, tables, figures, pictures, audio, animation and video. In a task- or domain-oriented way of interaction current technology allows the recognition and interpretation of rather natural speech and language in dialogues. However, rather than the current two-dimensional web-pages, many interesting parts of the Web will become three-dimensional, allowing the building of virtual worlds inhabited by user and task agents, with which the user can interact using different types of modalities, including speech and language interpretation and generation. Agents can work on behalf of users, hence, human computer interaction will make use of `indirect management', rather than interacting through direct manipulation of data
