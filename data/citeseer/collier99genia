The GENIA project: corpus-based knowledge acquisition and information extraction from genome research papers We present an outline of the genome information acquisition (GENIA) project for automatically extracting biochemical information from journal papers and abstracts. GENIA will be available over the Internet and is designed to aid in information extraction, retrieval and visualisation and to help reduce information overload on researchers. The vast repository of papers available online in databases such as MEDLINE is a natural environment in which to develop language engineering methods and tools and is an opportunity to show how language engineering can play a key role on the Internet. 1 Introduction  In the context of the global research effort to map the human genome, the Genome Informatics Extraction project, GENIA (GENIA, 1999), aims to support such research by automatically extracting information from biochemical papers and their abstracts such as those available from MEDLINE (MEDLINE, 1999) written by domain specialists. The vast repository of research papers which are the results...
