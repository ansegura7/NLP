Probabilistic Logic Programming with Conditional Constraints . We introduce a new approach to probabilistic logic programming in which probabilities are defined over a set of possible worlds. More precisely, classical program clauses are extended by a subinterval of [0; 1] that describes a range for the conditional probability of the head of a clause given its body. We then analyze the complexity of selected probabilistic logic programming tasks. It turns out that probabilistic logic programming is computationally more complex than classical logic programming. More precisely, the tractability of special cases of classical logic programming generally does not carry over to the corresponding special cases of probabilistic logic programming. Moreover, we also draw a precise picture of the complexity of deciding and computing tight logical consequences in probabilistic reasoning with conditional constraints in general. We then present linear optimization techniques for deciding satisfiability and computing tight logical consequences of probabilistic...
