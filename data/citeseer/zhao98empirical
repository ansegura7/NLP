Empirical Performance Analysis of Linear Discriminant Classifiers In face recognition literature, holistic template matching systems and geometrical local feature based systems have been pursued . In the holistic approach, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) are popular ones. More recently, the combination of PCA and LDA has been proposed as a superior alternative over pure PCA and LDA. In this paper, we illustrate the rationales behind these methods and the pros and cons of applying them to pattern classification task. A theoretical performance analysis of LDA suggests applying LDA over the principal components from the original signal space or the subspace. The improved performance of this combined approach is demonstrated through experiments conducted on both simulated data and real data.  1 Introduction  Statistical pattern recognition techniques have been successfully applied to many problems, including speech recognition, automatic target recognition and image classification. For a given pattern classificat...
