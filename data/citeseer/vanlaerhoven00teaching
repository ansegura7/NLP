Teaching Context to Applications Enhancing applications by adding one or more  sensors is not new. Incorporating machinelearning  techniques to fuse the data from the  sensors into a high-level context description is  less obvious. This paper describes an architecture  that combines a hierarchy of self-organizing  networks and a Markov chain to enable on-line  context recognition. Depending on both user and  application, the user can teach a context  description to the system whenever he or she  likes to, as long as the behavior of the sensors is  different enough. Finally, consequences and  complications of this new approach are  discussed.  1
