Executing Query Packs in ILP Inductive logic programming systems usually send large numbers  of queries to a database. The lattice structure from which these queries  are typically selected causes many of these queries to be highly similar. As a consequence, independent execution of all queries may involve a lot of redundant computation. We propose a mechanism for executing a hierarchically  structured set of queries (a "query pack") through which a lot of redundancy in the computation is removed. We have incorporated our  query pack execution mechanism in the ILP systems Tilde and Warmr by implementing a new Prolog engine ilProlog which provides support  for pack execution at a lower level. Experimental results demonstrate  significant efficiency gains. Our query pack execution mechanism is very  general in nature and could be incorporated in most other ILP systems,  with similar efficiency improvements to be expected.
