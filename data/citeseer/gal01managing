Managing Periodically Updated Data in Relational Databases: A Stochastic Modeling Approach Recent trends in information management involve the periodic transcription  of data onto secondary devices in a networked environment, and the proper  scheduling of these transcriptions is critical for efficient data management. To assist  in the scheduling process, we are interested in modeling data obsolescence, that is,  the reduction of consistency over time between a relation and its replica. The modeling  is based on techniques from the field of stochastic processes, and provides several  stochastic models for content evolution in the base relations of a database, taking  referential integrity constraints into account. These models are general enough to  accommodate most of the common scenarios in databases, including batch insertions  and life spans both with and without memory. As an initial "proof of concept" of the  applicability of our approach, we validate the insertion portion of our model framework  via experiments with real data feeds. We also discuss a set of transcription  protocols which make use of the proposed stochastic model.
