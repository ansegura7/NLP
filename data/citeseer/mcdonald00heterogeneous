Heterogeneous Database Integration Using Agent-Oriented Information Systems : The Department of Defense (DOD) has an extensive family of models used to simulate the mission level interaction of weapon systems. Interoperability and reuse of the underlying data files used to create simulation scenarios pose great challenges in this regard. Unlike traditional data integration methods common to federated database research, the emerging field of agent-oriented information systems (AOIS) views data as the central focus of an application while also providing an overall architectural framework for application development. We develop an AOIS solution relevant to this problem domain by combining object-oriented data modeling (OMT), a persistent programming language using a commercial objectoriented database (ObjectStore#), and an agentoriented analysis and design methodology (MaSE). Requirements from a contractor-led effort at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) known as CERTCORT are the basis for analysis and design of our system. We implement prototypical information-layer applications to conceptually demonstrate the reusability and integration of scenarios across simulation models.
