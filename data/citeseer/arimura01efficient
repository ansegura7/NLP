Efficient Learning of Semi-structured Data from Queries This paper studies the polynomial-time learnability of the  classes of ordered gapped tree patterns (OGT) and ordered gapped forests  (OGF) under the into-matching semantics in the query learning model  of Angluin. The class OGT is a model of semi-structured database query  languages, and a generalization of both the class of ordered/unordered  tree pattern languages and the class of non-erasing regular pattern languages.
