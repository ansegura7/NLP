A Survey of Agent-Oriented Methodologies . This article introduces the current agent-oriented methodologies. It discusseswhat approacheshave been followed (mainly extending existing objectoriented and knowledge engineering methodologies), the suitability of these approaches for agent modelling, and some conclusions drawn from the survey. 1 Introduction Agent technology has received a great deal of attention in the last few years and, as a result, the industry is beginning to get interested in using this technology to develop its own products. In spite of the different developed agent theories, languages, architectures and the successful agent-based applications, very little work for specifying (and applying) techniques to develop applications using agent technology has been done. The role of agent-oriented methodologies is to assist in all the phases of the life cycle of an agent-based application, including its management. This article reviews the current approaches to the development of an agent-oriented (AO) methodology. ...
