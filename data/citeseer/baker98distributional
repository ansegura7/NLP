Distributional Clustering of Words for Text Classification This paper applies Distributional Clustering (Pereira  et al. 1993) to document classification. The approach clusters words into groups based on the distribution of class labels associated with each word. Thus, unlike some other unsupervised dimensionality-reduction techniques, such as Latent Semantic Indexing, we are able to compress the feature space much more aggressively, while still maintaining high document classification accuracy. Experimental results obtained on three real-world data sets show that we can reduce the feature dimensionality by three orders of magnitude and lose only 2% accuracy---significantly better than Latent Semantic Indexing (Deerwester et al. 1990), class-based clustering (Brown et al. 1992), feature selection by mutual information (Yang and Pederson 1997), or Markovblanket -based feature selection (Koller and Sahami 1996). We also show that less aggressive clustering sometimes results in improved classification accuracy over classification without clusteri...
