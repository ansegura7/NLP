Aspects of Network Edge Intelligence Is it the case that the migration of intelligence from the core of networks to the  periphery is simply a function of the IP protocols? Or are there more fundamental  forces at work? This report addresses this issue from the perspective of core network  protocols, mobile networking and the emerging embedded Internet. It identifies the  forces at work, and concludes that the long term trends are driven by more than simply  the end-to-end argument. If the logical progression of this trend is that intelligence  will migrate to the embedded Internet, then a new type of peripheral intelligence may  form the basis for further progress. The report concludes by identifying the challenges  for the embedded Internet in constructed environments.
