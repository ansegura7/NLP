Augmented Reality Tracking in Natural Environments Tracking, or camera pose determination, is the main technical challenge in creating augmented realities. Constraining the degree to which the environment may be altered to support tracking heightens the challenge. This paper describes several years of work at the USC Computer Graphics and Immersive Technologies (CGIT) laboratory to develop self-contained, minimally intrusive tracking systems for use in both indoor and outdoor settings. These hybrid-technology tracking systems combine vision and inertial sensing with research in fiducial design, feature detection, motion estimation, recursive filters, and pragmatic engineering to satisfy realistic application requirements.
