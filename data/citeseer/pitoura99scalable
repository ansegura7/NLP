Scalable Processing of Read-Only Transactions in Broadcast Push Recently, push-based delivery has attracted considerable attention as a means of disseminating information to large client populations in both wired and wireless settings. In this paper, we address the problem of ensuring the consistency and currency of client read-only transactions in the presence of updates. To this end, additional control information is broadcast. A suite of methods is proposed that vary in the complexity and volume of the control information transmitted and subsequently differ in response times, degrees of concurrency, and space and processing overheads. The proposed methods are combined with caching to improve query latency. The relative advantages of each method are demonstrated through both simulation results and qualitative arguments. Read-only transactions are processed locally at the client without contacting the server and thus the proposed approaches are scalable, i.e., their performance is independent of the number of clients.  1.
