Mobile Agents In Intrusion Detection And Response Effective intrusion detection capability is an elusive goal, not solved easily or with a single mechanism. However, mobile software agents go a long way toward realizing the ideal behavior desired in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This paper is an initial look at the relatively unexplored terrain of using mobile agents for intrusion detection and response. It looks not only at the benefits derived from mobility, but also those associated with software agent technology. We explore these benefits in some detail and propose a number of innovative ways to apply agent mobility to address the shortcomings of current IDS designs and implementations. We also look at new approaches for automating response to an intrusion, once detected. 1  Appeared in the proceedings of the 12th Annual Canadian Information Technology Security Symposium, Ottawa, Canada, June 2000.
