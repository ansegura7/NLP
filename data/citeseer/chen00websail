WebSail: From On-line Learning to Web Search In this paper we investigate the applicability of on-line learning algorithms to the real-world problem of web search. Consider that web documents are indexed using n Boolean features. We first present a practically efficient on-line learning algorithm TW2 to search for web documents represented by a disjunction of at most k relevant features. We then design and implement WebSail, a real-time adaptive web search learner, with TW2 as its learning component. WebSail learns from the user's relevance feedback in real-time and helps the user to search for the desired web documents. The architecture and performance of WebSail are also discussed.
