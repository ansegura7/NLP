Specialising The Other Way Around In this paper, we present a program transformation based on bottom up evaluation of logic programs. We explain that using this technique, programs can be "specialised" w.r.t. a set of unit clauses instead of a query. Moreover, examples indicate that excellent specialisation can be obtained when this bottom up transformation is combined with a more traditional top down approach, resulting in conceptually cleaner techniques requiring a less complicated control than one overall approach.  1
