Matching in Description Logics: Preliminary Results Matching of concepts with variables (concept patterns) is a relatively new operation that has been introduced in the context of concept description languages (description logics), originally to help discard unimportant aspects of large concepts appearing in industrial-strength knowledge bases. This paper proposes a new approach to performing matching, based on a "concept-centered" normal form, rather than the more standard "structural subsumption" normal form for concepts. As a result, matching can be performed (in polynomial time) using  arbitrary concept patterns of the description language FL: , thus removing restrictions from previous work. The paper also addresses the question of matching problems with additional "side conditions", which were motivated by practical experience.  1 Introduction  The traditional inference problems for Description Logic (DL) systems (like subsumption) are now wellinvestigated. This means that algorithms are available for solving the subsumption proble...
