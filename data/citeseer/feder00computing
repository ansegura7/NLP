Computing the Median with Uncertainty We consider a new model for computing with uncertainty. It is desired to compute a function f(X1 ; : : : ; Xn) where X1 ; : : : ; Xn are unknown, but guaranteed to lie in specified intervals I1 ; : : : ; In . It is possible to query the precise value of any X j at a cost c j . The goal is to pin down the value of f to within a precision ffi at a minimum possible cost. We focus on the selection function f which returns the value of the kth smallest argument. We present optimal offline and online algorithms for this problem.  1 Introduction  Consider the following model for computing with uncertainty. We wish to compute a function f(X1 ; : : : ; Xn) over n real-valued arguments. The values of the variables X1 , : : :, Xn are not known in advance; however, we are provided with real intervals I1 ; : : : ; In along with a guarantee that for each j, X j 2 I j . Furthermore, it is possible to query the true value x j of each X j at a cost c j . The goal is to pin down the value of f into an i...
