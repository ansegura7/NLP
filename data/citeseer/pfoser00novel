Novel Approaches to the Indexing of Moving Object Trajectories The domain of spatiotemporal applications is a treasure trove  of new types of data and queries. However, work in this area  is guided by related research from the spatial and temporal  domains, so far, with little attention towards the true nature  of spatiotemporal phenomena. In this work, the focus is on a  spatiotemporal sub-domain, namely the trajectories of  moving point objects. We present new types of  spatiotemporal queries, as well as algorithms to process  those. Further, we introduce two access methods this kind of  data, namely the Spatio-Temporal R-tree (STR-tree) and the  Trajectory-Bundle tree (TB-tree). The former is an R-tree  based access method that considers the trajectory identity in  the index as well, while the latter is a hybrid structure, which  preserves trajectories as well as allows for R-tree typical  range search in the data. We present performance studies that  compare the two indices with the R-tree (appropriately  modified, for a fair comparison) under a varying set of  spatiotemporal queries, and we provide guidelines for a  successful choice among them.
