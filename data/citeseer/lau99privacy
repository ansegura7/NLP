Privacy Interfaces for Information Management this article, we propose a set of guidelines for designing privacy interfaces that facilitate the creation, inspection, modification, and monitoring of privacy policies. These guidelines are based on our experience with COLLABCLIO---a system that supports automated sharing of Web browsing histories. COLLAB- CLIO stores a person's browsing history and makes it searchable by content, keyword, and other attributes. A typical COLLABCLIO query might be: "Show me all the pages Tessa has visited in the .edu domain that contain the phrase `direct manipulation.' " Since a COLLABCLIO user can make queries regarding the browsing history of other users, there are obvious privacy concerns.
