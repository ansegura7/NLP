Cache Management in CORBA Distributed Object Systems For many distributed data intensive applications, the default remote invocation of CORBA objects by clients is not acceptable because of performance degradation. Caching enables clients to invoke operations locally on distributed objects instead of fetching them from remote servers. This paper addresses the design and implementation of a specific caching approach for CORBA-based systems. We propose a new removal algorithm which uses a double linked structure and a hash table for eviction. We also present a new variation of optimistic two phase locking for consistency control, which does not require a lock at the client side by using a perprocess caching design. With the experiments we have performed, we demonstrate that the proposed caching approach provides an important performance gain: the caching with half buffer saves up to 45% of access time and the caching with full buffer saves up to 50% of access time. The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) provides several adv...
