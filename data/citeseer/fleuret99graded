Graded Learning for Object Detection Our goal is to detect all instances of a generic object class, such as a face, in greyscale scenes. The design of the algorithm is motivated by computational efficiency. The search is coarse-to-fine in both the exploration of poses and the representation of the object class. Starting from training examples, we recursively learn a hierarchy of spatial arrangements of edge fragments, graded by their size (sparsity). The arrangements have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. Instead, they are selected to be "decomposable": Each can be split into two correlated subarrangements, each of which can be further divided, etc. As a result, the probability of an arrangement of size k appearing on an object instance decays slowly with k. We demonstrate this both theoretically and in experiments in which detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of various sizes. 1 Introduction  Starting with a training set of examples of a generic object class (e.g., "face"), our goal...
