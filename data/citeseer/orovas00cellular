A Cellular Neural Associative Array for Symbolic Vision . A system which combines the descriptional power of symbolic representations with the parallel and distributed processing model of cellular automata and the speed and robustness of connectionist symbol processing is described. Following a cellular automata based approach, the aim of the system is to transform initial symbolic descriptions of patterns to corresponding object level descriptions in order to identify patterns in complex or noisy scenes. A learning algorithm based on a hierarchical structural analysis is used to learn symbolic descriptions of objects. The underlying symbolic processing engine of the system is a neural based associative memory (AURA) which use enables the system to operate in high speed. In addition, the use of distributed representations allow both efficient inter-cellular communications and compact storage of rules. 1 Introduction  One of the basic features of syntactic and structural pattern recognition systems is the use of the structure of the patterns...
