The Structure of Object Transportation and Orientation in Human-Computer Interaction An experiment was conducted to investigate the relationship between object transportation and object orientation by the human hand in the context of humancomputer interaction (HCI). This work merges two streams of research: the structure of interactive manipulation in HCI and the natural hand prehension in human motor control. It was found that object transportation and object orientation have a parallel, interdependent structure which is generally persistent over different visual feedback conditions. The notion of concurrency and interdependence of multidimensional visuomotor control structure can provide a new framework for human-computer interface evaluation and design.  Keywords  Direct manipulation, input device, multi-dimensional control, visuomotor control, visual conditions, information processing, interface design, virtual reality.  INTRODUCTION  Object manipulation is a basic operation in humancomputer interaction (HCI). Modern computer technology advances towards affording m...
