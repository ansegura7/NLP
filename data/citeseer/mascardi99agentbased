An Agent-Based Approach to Distributed Simulation, Distributed Prototyping and Software Integration Due to nowadays huge availability of data and software, a software developer must be able  not only to invent good algorithms and implement them efficiently, but also to assemble existing  components to create, timely and economically, a new application.  Prototyping is a software engineering paradigm particularly suitable for the compositional  approach to software development. A working prototype embedding the heterogeneous software  which will be used in the final application proves useful for at least two reasons:  ffl the prototype is definitely closer to the final application;  ffl the re-usability of the legacy software can be evaluated before the final application is  built.  The distribution of the software to be integrated within the prototype must be taken into  account, as well as the distribution of the prototype execution. This would help to gain in  efficiency and closeness to the final application.  The aim of this thesis is to exploit the "multi-agent system" abstracti...
