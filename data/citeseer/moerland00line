An On-Line EM Algorithm Applied to Kernel PCA Kernel principal component analysis (Pca) is a recent method for non-linear feature extraction. Applying kernel Pca to a data set with N patterns requires storing and nding the eigenvectors of a N N kernel matrix. This paper describes how an Expectation-Maximization (Em) algorithm for standard Pca can be adapted to kernel Pca without having to store the kernel matrix. Experimental results are given where Em for kernel Pca extracts up to 512 non-linear features from a data set with 15,000 examples. The extracted features lead to good performance when used as pre-processed data for a linear classifier. A novel on-line Em algorithm for Pca is presented and shown to further speed up the learning process.
