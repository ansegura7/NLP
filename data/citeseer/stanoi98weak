Weak Consistency in Distributed Data Warehouses We propose and analyze a novel multiple-view model of a distributed data warehouse. Views are represented in a hierarchical fashion, incorporating data from base sources as well as possibly other views. Current approaches to maintain consistency in such a model require that data stored in a view derived from base data via different paths be from the same state of the base relation. This type of consistency criterion is too restrictive for some applications. Hence, we propose relaxing the synchronization constraints at the view level and develop a model that allows views to set their own constraints by enforcing individual conditions for all pairs of paths. We define a correctness criteria for updates in this particular model, and analyze the new requirements necessary for maintaining the consistency of data. Finally, we propose an algorithm to ensure that views are updated consistently.  Keywords multi-view data warehouse, distributed system, consistency, updates  1 Introduction  A dat...
