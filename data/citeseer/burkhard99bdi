BDI Design Principles and Cooperative Implementation - A Report on RoboCup Agents This report discusses two major views on BDI deliberation for autonomous agents. The first view is a rather conceptual one, presenting general BDI design principles, namely heuristic options, decomposed reasoning and layered planning, which enable BDI deliberation in realtime domains. The second view is focused on the practical application of the design principles in RoboCup Simulation League. This application not only evaluates the usefulness in deliberation but also the usefulness in rapid cooperative implementation. We compare this new approach, which has been used in the Vice World Champion team AT Humboldt 98, to the old approach of AT Humboldt 97, and we outline the extensions for AT Humboldt 99, which are still under work. Conditions faced by deliberation in multi agent contexts differ significantly from the basic assumption of classical AI search and planning. Traditional game playing methods for example assume a static well-known setting and a fixed round-based interaction of ...
