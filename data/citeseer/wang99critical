A Critical Note on Stable Model Semantics In this paper, we argue that both the stable model semantics and  its three-valued version are conceptually flawed.  1 Introduction  The semantics of logic programming and deductive databases has been extensively studied in the past two decades. A whole spectrum of semantic theories for logic programs have been proposed, ranging from those that infer very little information from a logic program ("skeptical") to those that infer a great deal ("credulous"). The most skeptical semantics is the well-founded semantics [4] while the most credulous is the the stable model semantics [6] and its different but equivalent three-valued versions, including 3-stable models [8], partial stable models [9] and preferred extensions [2].  The chief drawback of the stable semantics is that a two-valued stable model is not defined for all logic programs. In the three-valued variant a model is always defined but that model may leave all atoms undetermined [8]. The original problem of the non-existence of a ...
