Evolving More Efficient Digital Circuits By Allowing Circuit Layout Evolution and Multi-Objective Fitness We use evolutionary search to design combinational logic circuits. The technique is based on evolving the functionality and connectivity of a rectangular array of logic cells whose dimension is defined by the circuit layout. The main idea of this approach is to improve quality of the circuits evolved by the genetic algorithm (GA) by reducing the number of active gates used. We accomplish this by combining two ideas: 1) using multiobjective fitness function; 2) evolving circuit layout. It will be shown that using these two approaches allows us to increase the quality of evolved circuits. The circuits are evolved in two phases. Initially the genome fitness in given by the percentage of output bits that are correct. Once 100% functional circuits have been evolved, the number of gates actually used in the circuit is taken into account in the fitness function. This allows us to evolve circuits with 100% functionality and minimise the number of active gates in circuit structure. The populati...
