Multifaceted Object Modeling with Roles: A Comprehensive Approach In conventional object-oriented (O-O) database systems, it is assumed silently that fundamental object types and inter-object relationships can be classfied statically, prescribing basic structural and behavioral properties for all the objects in the database. Such a classification-based approach falls short of supporting emerging data-intensive applications requiring more advanced dynamic capabilities. One of such advanced capabilities is the support of modeling subjectivity -- the ability to (among others) provide multiple perspectives of application objects or to model socalled "multifaceted objects" which, on different stages, can exhibit different forms and behavior. This article describes an extended O-O approach that we have been investigating for this purpose. Advanced features embodied by dynamic and versatile role facilities have been introduced into a conventional object-oriented model, which facilitates specifying and modeling such applications in a natural, incremental and...
