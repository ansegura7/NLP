Progressive KNN Search Using B+-trees In high-dimensional databases, nearest neighbor (NN) search is computationally expensive. However, for many applications where small errors can be tolerated, determining approximate answers quickly has become an acceptable alternative. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that exploits the iMinMax( ) scheme [16] to facilitate nearest neighbor processing. The proposed algorithm distinguishes itself from existing algorithms in two ways. First, it evaluates KNN queries progressively, i.e., it begins by examining a small amount of data to produce approximate answers quickly; as more data are examined, the approximate answers are refined. Second, unlike existing progressive algorithms that access data randomly, the algorithm searches the data space in a systematic and `optimal' manner. Our performance study shows that the proposed scheme can produce approximate answers very quickly. More importantly, the quality of the answers are not sacrified significantly. Such an extension is applicable to other relevant methods such as the Pyramid Technique[2].
