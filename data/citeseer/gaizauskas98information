Information Extraction: Beyond Document Retrieval In this paper we give a synoptic view of the growth text processing technology of information  extraction (IE) whose function is to extract information about a pre-specified  set of entities, relations or events from natural language texts and to record this information  in structured representations called templates. Here we describe the nature of the  IE task, review the history of the area from its origins in AI work in the 1960's and  70's till the present, discuss the techniques being used to carry out the task, describe  application areas where IE systems are or are about to be at work, and conclude with  a discussion of the challenges facing the area. What emerges is a picture of an exciting  new text processing technology with a host of new applications, both on its own and in  conjunction with other technologies, such as information retrieval, machine translation  and data mining.
