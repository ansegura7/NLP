Sensory-Motor Primitives as a Basis for Imitation: Linking Perception to Action and Biology to Robotics ing away from the specific coding of the spinal fields, the examples from neurobiology provide the framework for a motor control system based on a small number of additive primitives (or basis behaviors) sufficient for a rich output movement repertoire. Our previous work (Matari'c 1995, Matari'c 1997), inspired by the same biological results, has successfully applied the idea of basis behaviors to control of mobile robots 6  by fitting it directly into the modular behavior-based control paradigm. Applictions of schema theory (Arbib 1992) to behavior-based mobile robots (Arkin 1987) have employed a similar notion of composable behaviors, stemming from foundations in neuroscience (Arbib 1981, Arbib 1989).  The idea of using such primitives for articulator control has been recently studied in robotics. Williamson (1996) and Marjanovi'c, Scassellati & Williamson (1996) developed a 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) robot arm controller. While in the biological and mobile robotics work primitives c...
