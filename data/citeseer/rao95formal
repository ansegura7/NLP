Formal Models and Decision Procedures for Multi-Agent Systems The study of computational agents capable of rational behaviour has received a great deal of attention in recent years. A number of theoretical formalizations for such multiagent systems have been proposed. However, most of these formalizations do not have a strong semantic basis nor a sound and complete axiomatization. Hence, it has not been clear as to how these formalizations could be used in building agents in practice. This paper explores a particular type of multi-agent system, in which each agent is viewed as having the three mental attitudes of belief (B), desire (D), and intention (I). It provides a family of multi-modal branching-time BDI logics with a semantics that is grounded in traditional decision theory and a possible-worlds framework, categorizes them, provides sound and complete axiomatizations, and gives constructive tableaubased decision procedures for testing the satisfiability and validity of formulas. The computational complexity of these decision procedures is n...
