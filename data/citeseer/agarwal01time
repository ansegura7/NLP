Time Responsive Indexing Schemes for Moving Points We develop new indexing schemes for storing a set of points in one or two dimensions, each  moving along a linear trajectory, so that a range query at a given future time t q can be answered  efficiently. The novel feature of our indexing schemes is that the number of I/Os required to  answer a query depends not only on the size of the data set and on the number of points in the  answer but also on the difference between t q and the current time; queries close to the current  time are answered fast, while queries that are far away in the future or in the past may take  more time.
