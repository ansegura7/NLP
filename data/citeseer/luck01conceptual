A Conceptual Framework for Agent Definition and Development The use of agents of many different kinds in a variety of fields of computer science and  artificial intelligence is increasing rapidly and is due, in part, to their wide applicability. The  richness of the agent metaphor that leads to many different uses of the term is, however, both a  strength and a weakness: its strength lies in the fact that it can be applied in very many different  ways in many situations for different purposes; the weakness is that the term agent is now used so  frequently that there is no commonly accepted notion of what it is that constitutes an agent. This  paper addresses this issue by applying formal methods to provide a defining framework for agent  systems. The Z specification language is used to provide an accessible and unified formal account  of agent systems, allowing us to escape from the terminological chaos that surrounds agents. In  particular, the framework precisely and unambiguously provides meanings for common concepts  and terms, enables alternative models of particular classes of system to be described within it, and  provides a foundation for subsequent development of increasingly more refined concepts.
