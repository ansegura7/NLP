Vision-Guided Navigation Using SHOSLIF . This paper presents an unconventional approach to vision-guided autonomous navigation. The system recalls information about scenes and navigational experience using content-based retrieval from a visual database. To achieve a high applicability to various road types, we do not impose a priori scene features, such as road edges, that the system must use. But rather, the system automatically derives features from images during supervised learning. To accomplish this, the system uses principle component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to automatically derive the most expressive features (MEF) for scene reconstruction or the most discriminating features (MDF) for scene classi cation. These features best describe or classify the population of the scenes and approximate complex decision regions using piecewise linear boundaries up to a desired accuracy. A new self-organizing scheme called recursive partition tree (RPT) is used for automatic construction of a vision-and-control da...
