TravelPlan: A MultiAgent System to Solve Web Electronic Travel Problems This paper presents TravelPlan, a multiagent architecture to co-operative work between different elements (human and/or software) whose main goal is to recommend useful solutions in the electronic tourism domain to system users. The system uses different types of intelligent autonomous agents whose main characteristics are cooperation, negotiation, learning, planning and knowledge sharing. The information used by the intelligent agents is heterogeneous and geographically distributed. The main information source of the system is Internet (the web). Other information sources are distributed knowledge bases in the own system.. The process to obtain, filter, and store the information is performed automatically by agents. This information is translated into a homogeneous format for high-level reasoning in order to obtain different partial solutions. Partial solutions are reconstructed into a general solution (or solutions) to be presented to the user. The system will recommend different solution...
