A Competitive Layer Model for Feature Binding and Sensory Segmentation We present a recurrent neural network for feature binding and sensory segmentation,  the competitive layer model (CLM). The CLM uses topographically structured  competitive and cooperative interactions in a layered network to partition a set of input  features into salient groups. The dynamics is formulated within a standard additive recurrent  network with linear threshold neurons. Contextual relations among features are  coded by pairwise compatibilities which define an energy function to be minimized by  the neural dynamics. Due to the usage of dynamical winner-take-all circuits the model  gains more flexible response properties than spin models of segmentation by exploiting  amplitude information in the grouping process. We prove analytic results on the convergence  and stable attractors of the CLM, which generalize earlier results on winner-take-all networks, and incorporate deterministic annealing for robustness against local  minima. The piecewise linear dynamics of the CLM allows a linear eigensubspace  analysis which we use to analyze the dynamics of binding in conjunction with annealing.  For the example of contour detection we show how the CLM can integrate  figure-ground segmentation and grouping into a unified model.
