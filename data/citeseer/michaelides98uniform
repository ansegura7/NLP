A Uniform Approach to Programming the World Wide Web We propose a uniform model for programming distributed web applications. The model is based on the concept of web computation places and provides mechanisms to coordinate distributed computations at these places, including peer-to-peer communication between places and a uniform mechanism to initiate computation in remote places. Computations can interact with the flow of http requests and responses, typically as clients, proxies or servers in the web architecture. We have implemented the model using the global pointers and remote service requests provided by the Nexus communication library. We present the model and its rationale, with some illustrative examples, and we describe the implementation.  1 Introduction  Many web applications require a significant amount of computation which may be distributed and requires coordination; these applications use the web infrastructure to good advantage but are often constrained by the architecture, which is fundamentally client-server. A variety...
