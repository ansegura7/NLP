A Methodology and Modelling Technique for Systems of BDI Agents The construction of large-scale embedded software systems demands the use of design methodologies and modelling techniques that support abstraction, inheritance, modularity, and other mechanisms for reducing complexity and preventing error. If multi-agent systems are to become widely accepted as a basis for large-scale applications, adequate agentoriented methodologies and modelling techniques will be essential. This is not just to ensure that systems are reliable, maintainable, and conformant, but to allow their design, implementation, and maintenance to be carried out by software analysts and engineers rather than researchers. In this paper we describe an agent-oriented methodology and modelling technique for systems of agents based upon the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) paradigm. Our models extend existing Object-Oriented (OO) models. By building upon and adapting existing, well-understood techniques, we take advantage of their maturity to produce an approach that can be easily lear...
