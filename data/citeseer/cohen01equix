EquiX-A Search and Query Language for XML EquiX is a search language for XML that combines the power of querying with the  simplicity of searching. Requirements for such languages are discussed and it is shown  that EquiX meets the necessary criteria. Both a graph-based abstract syntax and a formal  concrete syntax are presented for EquiX queries. In addition, the semantics is defined and an  evaluation algorithm is presented. The evaluation algorithm is polynomial under combined  complexity.  EquiX combines pattern matching, quantification and logical expressions to query both  the data and meta-data of XML documents. The result of a query in EquiX is a set of XML  documents. A DTD describing the result documents is derived automatically from the query.  1
