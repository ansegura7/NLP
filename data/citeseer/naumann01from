From Databases to Information Systems - Information Quality Makes the Difference Research and business is currently moving from centralized databases towards in-formation systems integrating distributed and autonomous data sources. Simultane-ously, it is a well acknowledged fact that consideration of information quality - IQ-reasoning - is an important issue for large-scale integrated information systems. We show that IQ-reasoning can be the driving force of the current shift from databases to integrated information systems. In this paper, we explore the implications and consequences of this shift. All areas of answering user queries are affected - from user input, to query planning and query optimization, and finally to building the query result. The application of IQ-reasoning brings both challenges, such as new cost models for optimization, and opportunities, such as improved query planning. We highlight several emerging aspects and suggest solutions toward a pervasion of information quality in information systems.
