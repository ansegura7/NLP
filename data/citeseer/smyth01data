Data Mining At The Interface Of Computer Science And Statistics This chapter is written for computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and scientists who wish to gain a better understanding of the role of statistical thinking in modern data mining. Data mining has attracted considerable attention both in the research and commercial arenas in recent years, involving the application of a variety of techniques from both computer science and statistics. The chapter discusses how computer scientists and statisticians approach data from different but complementary viewpoints and highlights the fundamental differences between statistical and computational views of data mining. In doing so we review the historical importance of statistical contributions to machine learning and data mining, including neural networks, graphical models, and flexible predictive modeling. The primary conclusion is that closer integration of computational methods with statistical thinking is likely to become increasingly important in data mining applications.  Keywords: Data mining, statistics, pattern recognition, transaction data, correlation. 1.
