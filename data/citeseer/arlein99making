Making LDAP Active with the LTAP Gateway: Case Study in Providing Telecom Integration and Enhanced Services LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directories are being rapidly deployed on the Web. They are currently used to store data like white pages information, user profiles, and network device descriptions. These directories offer a number of advantages over current database technology in that they provide better support for heterogeneity and scalability. However, they lack some basic database functionality (e.g., triggers, transactions) that is crucial for Directory Enabled Networking (DEN) tasks like provisioning network services, allocating resources, reporting, managing end-to-end security, and offering mobile users customized features that follow them. In order to address these limitations while keeping the simplicity and performance features of LDAP directories, unbundled and portable solutions are needed. In this paper we discuss LDAP limitations we faced while building an LDAP meta-directory that integrates data from legacy telecom systems, and how LTAP (Lightweight Trigger Access Process), a portable gateway that adds active functionality to LDAP directories, overcomes these limitations.
