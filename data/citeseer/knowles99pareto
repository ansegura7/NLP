The Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy : A New Baseline Algorithm for Pareto Multiobjective Optimisation Most popular evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimisation maintain a population of solutions from which individuals are selected for reproduction. In this paper, we introduce a simpler evolution scheme for multiobjective problems, called the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest possible non-trivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm is identified as being a (1 + 1) evolution strategy, using local search from a population of one but using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate solution vectors. PAES is intended as a good baseline approach, against which more involved methods may be compared, and may also serve well in some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or competitive with population-based methods. The performance of the new algorithm is compared w...
