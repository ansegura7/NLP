Mobile Objects in Java Mobile Objects in Java provides support for object mobility in Java. Similarly to the RMI technique, a notion of client-side stub, called startpoint, is used to communicate transparently with a server-side stub, called endpoint. Objects and associated endpoints are allowed to migrate. Our approach takes care of routing method calls using an algorithm that we studied in [22]. The purpose of this paper is to present and evaluate the implementation of this algorithm in Java. In particular, two different strategies for routing method invocations are investigated, namely call forwarding and referrals. The result of our experimentation shows that the latter can be more efficient by up to 19%.  1
