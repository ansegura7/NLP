Adaptation and Plasticity of User Interfaces . This paper introduces the notion of plasticity, a new property of interactive systems that denotes a particular type of user interface adaptation. It also presents a generic framework inspired from the model-based approach, for supporting the development of plastic user interfaces. This framework is illustrated with simple case studies.  KEYSWORDS. User interface adaptation, plasticity.  1. Introduction: A Design Space for Adaptation  In HCI, adaptation is modeled as two complementary system properties: adaptability and adaptivity. Adaptability is the capacity of the system to allow users to customize their system from a predefined set of parameters. Adaptivity is the capacity of the system to perform adaptation automatically without deliberate action from the user's part. Whether adaptation is performed on human requests or automatically, the design space for adaptation includes three additional orthogonal axes (see Figure 1):  . The target for adaptation. This axis denotes the enti...
