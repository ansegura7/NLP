Augmented Workspace: The World as Your Desktop . We live in a three dimensional world, and much of what we do and  how we interact in the physical world has a strong spatial component. Unfortunately,  most of our interaction with the virtual world is two dimensional. We  are exploring the extension of the 2D desktop workspace into the 3D physical  world, using a stereoscopic see-through head-mounted display. We have built a  prototype that enables us to overlay virtual windows on the physical world.  This paper describes the Augmented Workspace, which allows a user to pos ition  windows in a 3D work area.  Keywords.
