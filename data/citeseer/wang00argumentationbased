Argumentation-Based Abduction in Disjunctive Logic Programming In this paper we propose an argumentation-based semantic framework,  called DAS, for disjunctive logic programming. The basic idea  is to translate a disjunctive logic program into an argumentationtheoretic  framework. One unique feature of our proposed framework  is to consider the disjunctions of negative literals as possible assumptions  so as to represent incomplete information. In our framework,  three semantics PDH, CDH and WFDH are defined by three kinds of  acceptable hypotheses to represent credulous, moderate and skeptical  reasoning in AI, respectively. Further more, our semantic framework  can be extended to a wider class than that of disjunctive programs  (called bi-disjunctive logic programs). In addition to being a first serious  attempt of establishing an argumentation-theoretic framework  for disjunctive logic programming, DAS integrates and naturally extends  many key semantics, such as the minimal models, EGCWA, the  well-founded model, and the disjunctive stable models. In particular,  novel and interesting argumentation-theoretic characterizations of  the EGCWA and the disjunctive stable semantics are shown. Thus  the framework presented in this paper does not only provide a new  way of performing argumentation (abduction) in disjunctive deductive  databases, but also is a simple, intuitive and unifying semantic framework  for disjunctive logic programming.
