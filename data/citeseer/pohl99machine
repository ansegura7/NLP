Machine Learning and Knowledge Representation in the LaboUr Approach to User Modeling . In early user-adaptive systems, the use of knowledge representation methods for  user modeling has often been the focus of research. In recent years, however, the application  of machine learning techniques to control user-adapted interaction has become popular. In  this paper, we present and compare adaptive systems that use either knowledge representation  or machine learning for user modeling. Based on this comparison, several dimensions  are identified that can be used to distinguish both approaches, but also to characterize user  modeling systems in general. The LaboUr (Learning about the User) approach to user modeling  is presented which attempts to take an ideal position in the resulting multi-dimensional  space by combining machine learning and knowledge representation techniques. Finally, an  implementation of LaboUr ideas into the information server ELFI is sketched.  1 Introduction  While striving to achieve user-adapted interaction, user modeling researchers have often m...
