Specification of Heterogeneous Agent Architectures . Agent-based software applications need to incorporate agents having  heterogeneous architectures in order for each agent to optimally perform its  task. HEMASL is a simple meta-language used to specify intelligent agents and  multi-agent systems when different and heterogeneous agent architectures must  be used. HEMASL specifications are based on an agent model that abstracts several  existing agent architectures. The paper describes some of the features of the  language, presents examples of its use and outlines its operational semantics. We  argue that adding HEMASL to CaseLP, a specification and prototyping environment  for MAS, can enhance its flexibility and usability.  1 Introduction  Intelligent agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly being acknowledged as the "new" modelling techniques to be used to engineer complex and distributed software applications [17, 9]. Agent-based software development is concerned with the realization of software applications modelled ...
