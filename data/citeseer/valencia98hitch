Hitch hiker's Guide to ESQIMO - Computational model for analogy solving in IQ-tests ESQIMO is a computational model for analogy solving based on a topological formalism of representation. The source and the target analogs are represented as  simplexes and the analogy solving is modeled as a topological deformation of these simplexes along a polygonal chain and according to some constraints. We apply this framework to the resolution of IQ-tests typically presented as igiven A, B and C, ??nd D such that A is to B what C is to Dj. Keywords : Knowledge Representation, Diagrammatic Reasoning, Simplicial complexes, Analogy solving, CAT.  4  Introduction ESQIMO is a system that automatically solves the following type of IQ-tests:  Given three ??gures A, B and C, ??nd a ??gure D such that D is to C what B is to  A. These IQ-tests are a paradigmatic example of analogy solving problems. ESQIMO is thus a computational model for analogy solving. The framework used by ESQIMO to solve analogies is called CAT for Combinatorial Algebraic Topology. More precisely, ESQIMO models knowledg...
