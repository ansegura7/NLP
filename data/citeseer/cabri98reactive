Reactive Tuple Spaces for Mobile Agent Coordination Mobile active computational entities introduce peculiar problems in the coordination of distributed application components. The paper surveys several coordination models for mobile agent applications and outlines the advantages of uncoupled coordination models based on reactive blackboards. On this base, the paper presents the design and the implementation of the MARS system, a coordination tool for Java-based mobile agents. MARS defines Linda-like tuple spaces that can be programmed to react with specific actions to the accesses made by mobile agents.

Introduction  Traditional distributed applications are designed as a set of processes statically assigned to given execution environments and cooperating in a (mostly) network-unaware fashion [Adl95]. The  mobile agent paradigm, instead, defines applications composed by network-aware entities (agents) capable of changing their execution env...
