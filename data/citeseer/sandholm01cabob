CABOB: A Fast Optimal Algorithm for Combinatorial Auctions Combinatorial auctions where bidders can bid  on bundles of items can lead to more economical  allocations, but determining the winners is  NP-complete and inapproximable. We present  CABOB, a sophisticated search algorithm for  the problem. It uses decomposition techniques,  upper and lower bounding (also across components)  , elaborate and dynamically chosen bid ordering  heuristics, and a host of structural observations.  Experiments against CPLEX 7.0 show that  CABOB is usually faster, never drastically slower,  and in many cases with special structure, drastically  faster. We also uncover interesting aspects of  the problem itself. First, the problems with short  bids that were hard for the first-generation of specialized  algorithms are easy. Second, almost all of  the CATS distributions are easy, and become easier  with more bids. Third, we test a number of random  restart strategies, and show that they do not help on  this problem because the run-time distribution does  not have a heavy tail (at least not for CABOB).  1
