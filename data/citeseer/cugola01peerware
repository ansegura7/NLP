PeerWare: Core Middleware Support for Peer-to-Peer and Mobile Systems The pervasiveness of computer networks, together with the availability of wireless links, are steering distributed systems towards scenarios where computing is increasingly decentralized, decoupled, and dynamically reconfigurable. The popularity of and demand for applications that exploit mobile and peer-to-peer interactions is a symptom of such change. Nevertheless, by and large these applications are being built in an ad hoc manner, and often with architectures that, by sticking to the traditional client-server paradigm, do not fully capture and support the peculiar requirements of the new scenario.
