A Wearable 3D Augmented Reality Workspace This poster describes our work to build a wearable Augmented Reality system that supports true stereoscopic 3D graphics. Through a pen and pad interface well known 2D user interfaces can be presented to the user, whereas the tracking of the pen allows to use direct interaction with virtual objects. The system is assembled from off-the-shelf hardware components and serves as a basic test bed for user interface experiments related to collaboration between stationary and mobile AR users.  1.
