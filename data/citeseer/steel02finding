Finding Counterexamples to Inductive Conjectures We present an implementation of a method for ??nding counterexamples to universally quanti??ed inductive conjectures in ??rst-order logic. Our method uses the proof by consistency strategy to guide a search for a counterexample and a standard ??rst-order theorem prover to perform a concurrent check for inconsistency. We explain brie??y the theory behind the method, describe our implementation, and evaluate results achieved on a variety of incorrect conjectures from various sources. Some work in progress is also presented: we are applying the method to the veri??cation of cryptographic security protocols. In this context, a counterexample to a security property can indicate an attack on the protocol, and our method extracts the trace of messages exchanged in order to effect the attack. This application demonstrates the advantages of the method, in that quite complex side conditions decide whether a particular sequence of messages is possible. Using a theorem prover provides a natural way of dealing with this. Some early results are presented and we discuss future work. 1
