Learning Task Models for Collagen For an application-independent collaborative tool, a  key step is to develop a detailed task model for a particular  domain. This is a time consuming and dicult  task, and seems to require a fairly advanced knowledge  of AI representations for plans, goals, and recipes.  This paper discusses some preliminary ideas for making  it easier to construct and evolve task models, either  through interaction with a human domain expert,  through machine learning, or in a mixed-initiative system.  Introduction  An important trend in recent work on human-computer interaction and user modeling has been to view humancomputer interaction as a kind of collaboration. In this approach, the human user and the computer, often personied as an \agent," coordinate their actions toward achieving shared goals. Collagen is an application-independent collaboration manager based on the SharedPlan theory of task-oriented collaborative discourse (Grosz & Sidner, 1990; Rich & Sidner, 1998; Lesh, Rich, & Sidner, 199...
