MAPWEB: Cooperation between Planning Agents and Web Agents This paper presents MAPWeb (MultiAgent Planning in the Web), a multiagent system for cooperative work among dierent intelligent software agents whose main goal is to solve user planning problems using the information stored in the World Wide Web (Web). MAPWeb is made of a heterogeneous mixture of intelligent agents whose main characteristics are cooperation, reasoning, and knowledge sharing. The architecture of MAPWeb uses four types of agents:UserAgents that are the bridge between the users and the system; ControlAgents (Manager and Coach Agents) that are responsible to manage the rest of agents; PlannerAgents  that are able to solve planning problems; and nally WebAgents whose aim is to retrieve, represent and share information obtained from the Web. MAPWeb solves planning problems by means of cooperation between PlannerAgents and WebAgents. Instead of trying the PlannerAgent to solve the whole planning problem, the PlannerAgent focuses on a less restricted (and therefore easier to solve) problem (what we call an abstract problem) and cooperates with the WebAgents to validate and complete abstract solutions. In order for cooperation to take place, a common language and data structures have also been dened.
