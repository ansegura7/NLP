An Event-Driven Sensor Architecture for Low Power Wearables In this paper we define a software architecture for low power wearable computers. The architecture is event driven, and is designed so that application programs have access to sensor data without the need for polling. The software architecture is designed to allow for an underlying hardware architecture that can achieve maximal power efficiency by switching off parts of the hardware that are known not to be required.  INTRODUCTION  Wearable Computing places particular demands on software. It is characterised by having to accommodate a potentially large number of input devices which are simultaneously providing contextual data; a need to minimise processor activity to reduce battery consumption [1]; and the requirement for simplicity to aid debugging applications which may be used in adverse conditions.  As a result of our experiences with software which had none of the above features, we have developed an eventdriven sensor architecture and used it successfully for several applications...
