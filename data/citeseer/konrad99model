Model Generation for Natural-Language Semantic Analysis . Semantic analysis refers to the analysis of semantic representations by inference on the basis of semantic information and world knowledge. I present some potential applications of model generators and model generation theorem provers in the construction and analysis of natural-language semantics where both the process of model generation and the computed models are valuable sources of information. I discuss Bry and Torge's hyper-resolution tableaux calculus EP as an approach to model generation for natural-language semantic analysis. 1 Introduction  One goal of modern natural-language semantics has been to capture the conditions under which a sentence can be uttered truthfully. In logic-based semantic formalisms such as Discourse Representation Theory [17] or Montague Grammar [22], the representations constructed for natural-language sentences are logical formulas whose truth-conditions are described by their models. The construction of semantic representations requires, amongst oth...
