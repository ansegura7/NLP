Integrating Mobile Agents into Off-the-Shelf Web Servers: The M&M Approach The mobile agent paradigm provides a new approach for developing distributed systems. During the last two years, we have been working on a project that tries to overcome some of the limitations found in terms of programmability and usability of the mobile agent paradigm in real applications. In the M&M framework there are no agent platforms. Instead applications become agent-enabled by using simple JavaBeans components. In our approach the agents arrive and departure directly from the applications, interacting with them from the inside.
