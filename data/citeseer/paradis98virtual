A Virtual Document Interpreter for Reuse of Information . The importance of reuse of information is well recognised for electronic publishing. However, it is rarely achieved satisfactorily because of the complexity of the task: integrating different formats, handling updates of information, addressing document author's need for intuitiveness and simplicity, etc. An approach which addresses these problems is to dynamically generate and update documents through a descriptive definition of virtual documents. In this paper we present a document interpreter that allows gathering information from multiple sources, and combining it dynamically to produce a virtual document. Two strengths of our approach are: the generic information objects that we use, which enables access to distributed, heterogeneous data sources; and the interpreter's evaluation strategy, which permits a minimum of re-evaluation of the information objects from the data sources.
