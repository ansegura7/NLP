Engineering a multi-purpose test collection for Web retrieval experiments Past research into text retrieval methods for the Web has been restricted by the lack of a  test collection capable of supporting experiments which are both realistic and reproducible.  The 1.69 million document WT10g collection is proposed as a multi-purpose testbed for  experiments with these attributes, in distributed IR, hyperlink algorithms and conventional  ad hoc retrieval.  WT10g was constructed by selecting from a superset of documents in such a way that  desirable corpus properties were preserved or optimised. These properties include: a high  degree of inter-server connectivity, integrity of server holdings, inclusion of documents related  to a very wide spread of likely queries, and a realistic distribution of server holding sizes. We  conrm that WT10g contains exploitable link information using a site (homepage) nding  experiment. Our results show that, on this task, Okapi BM25 works better on propagated  link anchor text than on full text.
