Using Dynamic Mediation to Integrate COTS Entities in a Ubiquitous Computing Environment . The original vision of ubiquitous computing [14] is about enabling  people to more easily accomplish tasks through the seamless interworking  of the physical environment and a computing infrastructure.  A major challenge to the practical realization of this vision involves the  integration of commercial-o-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software  components: consider the awkwardness of such a mundane task as exporting  a textual memo written on a Palm Pilot to a Microsoft Word  document. It is not enough to overcome the protocol and data format  mismatches that currently impede the interoperation of these entities: for  the user experience to be truly seamless, we must provide a framework  for the dynamic connection of such endpoints on demand, to support the  ad-hoc interactions that are an integral part of ubiquitous computing. To  this end, we oer a dynamic mediation framework called Paths. A Path  consists of dynamically instantiated, automatically composable operators  that brid...
