Generating a Topically Focused VirtualReality Internet Surveys highlight that Internet users are frequently frustrated by failing to locate useful information, and by difficulty in browsing anarchically linked web-structures. We present a new Internet browsing application (called VR-net) that addresses these problems. It first identifies semantic domains consisting of tightly interconnected web-page groupings. The second part populates a 3D virtual world with these information sources, representing all relevant pages plus appropriate structural relations.
