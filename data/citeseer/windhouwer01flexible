Flexible and Scalable Digital Library Search In this report the development of a specialised search engine for a digital library is described. The proposed  system architecture consists of three levels: the conceptual, the logical and the physical level. The conceptual  level schema enables by its exposure of a domain specific schema semantically rich conceptual search. The  logical level provides a description language to achieve a high degree of flexibility for multimedia retrieval. The  physical level takes care of scalable and e#cient persistent data storage. The role, played by each level, changes  during the various stages of a search engine's lifecycle: (1) modeling the index, (2) populating and maintaining  the index and (3) querying the index. The integration of all this functionality allows the combination of both  conceptual and content-based querying in the query stage. A search engine for the Australian Open tennis  tournament website is used as a running example, which shows the power of the complete architecture and its  various components.
