IaDEA: A Development Environment Architecture for Building Generic Intelligent User Interface Agents The need exists in the work force for generic intelligent user interface agents to address the problem of increasing taskload that is overwhelming the human user. Interface agents could help alleviate user taskload by providing abstractions and intelligent assistance in a self-contained software agent that communicates with the user through the existing user interface and also adapts to user needs and behaviors. The benefits of a generic intelligent user interface agent environment is it can be applied to any highly interactive and information intensive software system from freight and parcel management systems to Wall Street financial investment and analysis. We desire to address the two following difficulties with developing interface agents: (1) The extensive number of existing computer systems makes it impractical to build these agents by hand for each system; (2) Any such agent must be compliant with existing user interface standards and business practices (e.g., the United States...
