Lossless Regular Views If the only information we have on a certain database is through a set of views, the question arises of whether this is sufficient to answer completely a given query. We say that the set of views is lossless with respect to the query, if, no matter what the database is, we can answer the query by solely relying on the content of the views. The question of losslessness has various applications, for example in query optimization, mobile computing, data warehousing, and data integration. We study this problem in a context where the database is semistructured, and both the query and the views are expressed as regular path queries. The form of recursion present in this class prevents us from applying known results to our case.
