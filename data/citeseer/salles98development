Development of a Computer Aided Geographic Database Design System This paper presents a prototype being developed at IC-UNICAMP to help environmental planners specify their application databases. The ultimate goal of the system presented is to reduce the impedance mismatch between the end-user's view of the geographic reality and its implementation in Geographic Information Systems (gis). The prototype offers users the possibility of specifying their application databases using concepts closer to their view of the world, by means of an object oriented geographic data model. This specification is mapped by the system to an intermediate object oriented schema, which can then be transformed into different underlying target geographic DBMS. The prototype was implemented using C and O2C on the O2 object oriented DBMS. 1 Introduction  A Geographic Information System -- gis, for short -- is a software that performs data management and retrieval operations for georeferenced data. The term refers to data about geographic phenomena associated with its location...
