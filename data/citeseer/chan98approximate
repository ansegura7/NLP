Approximate Nearest Neighbor Queries Revisited This paper proposes new methods to answer approximate nearest neighbor queries on a set of n points in d-dimensional Euclidean space. For any fixed constant d, a data structure with  O("  (1\Gammad)=2  n log n) preprocessing time and O("  (1\Gammad)=2  log n) query time achieves approximation factor 1 + " for any given 0 ! " ! 1; a variant reduces the "-dependence by a factor of "  \Gamma1=2  . For any arbitrary d, a data structure with O(d  2  n log n) preprocessing time and O(d  2  log n) query time achieves approximation factor O(d  3=2  ). Applications to various proximity problems are discussed. 1 Introduction  Let P be a set of n point sites in d-dimensional space IR  d  . In the well-known post office problem, we want to preprocess P into a data structure so that a site closest to a given query point q (called the  nearest neighbor of q) can be found efficiently. Distances are measured under the Euclidean metric. The post office problem has many applications within computational...
