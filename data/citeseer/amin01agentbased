Agent-Based Distance Vector Routing Mobile Agents are being proposed for an increasing variety of applications. Distance Vector Routing (DVR) is an example of one application that can benefit from an agent-based approach. DVR algorithms, such as RIP, have been shown to cause considerable network resource overhead due to the large number of messages generated at each host/router throughout the route update process. Many of these messages are wasteful since they do not contribute to the route discovery process. However, in an agent-based solution, the number of messages is bounded by the number of agents in the system. In this paper, we present an agent-based solution to DVR. In addition, we will describe agent migration strategies that improve the performance of the route discovery process, namely Random Walk and Structured Walk.
