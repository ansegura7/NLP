Intelligent Anticipated Exploration of Web Sites In this paper we describe a web search agent, called Global Search Agent (hereafter  GSA for short). GSA integrates and enhances several search techniques in order to  achieve significant improvements in the user-perceived quality of delivered information as  compared to usual web search engines. GSA features intelligent merging of relevant documents  from different search engines, anticipated selective exploration and evaluation of  links from the current resuk set, automated derivation of refined queries based on user relevance  feedback. System architecture as well as experimental accounts are also illustrated.
