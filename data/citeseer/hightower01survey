A Survey and Taxonomy of Location Systems for Ubiquitous Computing Emerging mobile computing applications often need to know where  things are physically located. To meet this need, many di#erent location  systems and technologies have been developed. In this paper we present  a the basic techniques used for location-sensing, describe a taxonomy of  location system properties, present a survey of research and commercial  location systems that define the field, show how the taxonomy can be  used to evaluate location-sensing systems, and o#er suggestions for future  research. It is our hope that this paper is a useful reference for researchers  and location-aware application builders alike for understanding and evaluating  the many options in this domain.  1
