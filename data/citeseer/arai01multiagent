Multiagent Systems Specification by UML Statecharts Aiming at Intelligent Manufacturing Multiagent systems are a promising new paradigm in computing,  which are contributing to various fields. Many theories and technologies  have been developed in order to design and specify multiagent systems,  however, no standard procedure is used at present. Industrial applications  often have a complex structure and need plenty of working  resources. They require a standard specification method as well. As the  standard method to design and specify software systems, we believe that  one of the key words is simplicity for their wide acceptance. In this paper,  we propose a method to specify multiagent systems, namely with UML  statecharts. We use them for specifying almost all aspects of multiagent  systems, because we think that it is an advantage to keep everything in  one type of diagram. We apply
