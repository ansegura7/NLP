Towards socially sophisticated BDI agents We present an approach to social reasoning that integrates prior work on norms and obligations with the BDI approach to agent architectures. Norms and obligations can be used to increase the eficiency of agent reasoning, and their explicit representation supports reasoning about a wide range of behaviour types in a single framework. We propose a modified BDI interpreter loop that takes norms and obligations into account in an agent's deliberation.
