Integrating the Document Object Model with Hyperlinks for Enhanced Topic Distillation and Information Extraction Topic distillation is the process of finding authoritative Web pages a comprehensive "hubs" which reciprocally endorse each other and are relevant to a given query. Hyperlink-based topic distillation has been traditionally applied to a macroscopic Web model where documents are nodes in a directed graph and hyperlinks are edges.Mas.M::[KP models miss va lua44 clues such aba4'::M na viga::M paa els,as templa]M2'0]K inclusions, whicha: embedded in HTML paLM using ma0KP taKP Consequently, results of ma:]6:1M2' distillaKP] atillaKP have been deterioraKP] inqua:1 ya s Webpa0: a becoming more complex.
