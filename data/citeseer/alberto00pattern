Pattern Search Methods for Molecular Geometry Problems This paper deals with the application of pattern search methods to the numerical  solution of a class of molecular geometry problems with important applications in  molecular physics and chemistry. The goal is to nd a conguration of a cluster or a  molecule with minimum total energy.  The minimization problems in this class of geometry molecular problems have no  constraints and the objective function is smooth. The diculties arise from the existence  of several local minima, and especially, from the expensive function evaluation  (total energy) and the possible non-availability of rst-order derivatives.  We introduce a pattern search approach that attempts to exploit the physical nature  of the problem by using energy lowering geometrical transformations. Numerical  results with a particular instance of this new class of pattern search methods and with  the parallel direct search method of Dennis and Torczon are presented showing the  promise of our approach.  Key words. molecular ...
