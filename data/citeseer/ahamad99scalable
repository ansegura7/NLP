Scalable Consistency Protocols for Distributed Services Abstract??A common way to address scalability requirements of distributed services is to employ server replication and client caching of objects that encapsulate the service state. The performance of such a system could depend very much on the protocol implemented by the system to maintain consistency among object copies. We explore scalable consistency protocols that never require synchronization and communication between all nodes that have copies of related objects. We achieve this by developing a novel approach called local consistency (LC). LC based protocols can provide increased flexibility and efficiency by allowing nodes control over how and when they become aware of updates to cached objects. We develop two protocols for implementing strong consistency using this approach and demonstrate that they scale better than a traditional invalidation based consistency protocol along the system load and geographic distribution dimensions of scale.
