Computational Logic and Multi-Agent Systems: a Roadmap Agent-based computing is an emerging computing paradigm that has  proved extremely successful in dealing with a number of problems arising  from new technological developments and applications. In this paper we  report the role of computational logic in modeling intelligent agents, by  analysing existing agent theories, agent-oriented programming languages  and applications, as well as identifying challenges and promising directions  for future research.  1 Introduction  In the past ten years the eld of agent-based computing has emerged and greatly expanded, due to new technological developments such as ever faster and cheaper computers, fast and reliable interconnections between them as well as the emergence of the world wide web. These developments have at the same time opened new application areas, such as electronic commerce, and posed new problems, such as that of integrating great quantities of information and building complex software, embedding legacy code. The establishment o...
