A Survey of Factory Control Algorithms which Can be Implemented in a Multi-Agent Heterarchy: Dispatching, Scheduling, and Pull This paper has not seriously addressed the question of what new algorithms are inspired by the multi-agent heterarchical paradigm, except in two cases. The Market-Driven Contract Net uses a new form of forward / backward scheduling called `cost-based forward / backwards continuum scheduling' which was inspired by the common agent concept of bidding. Also, Duffie's current work on developing agent-based deterministic simulation would be a new form of deterministic simulation as it attempts to automate the human interaction normally required for successful implementation of such systems. But in general we still have an open question of what new algorithms heterarchical agent architectures imply and what would be the performance of these new algorithms. Because a multi-agent heterarchy is a distributed computing paradigm, it would be worthwhile to investigate the communications overhead of these algorithms. Such evaluations are not generally reported. Such research would assure that not only can these algorithms be implemented in a multi-agent heterarchy, but that their implementation does not require excessive communications overhead. 6.
