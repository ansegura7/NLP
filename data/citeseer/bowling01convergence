Convergence of Gradient Dynamics with a Variable Learning Rate As multiagent environments become more prevalent  we need to understand how this changes the  agent-based paradigm. One aspect that is heavily  affected by the presence of multiple agents  is learning. Traditional learning algorithms have  core assumptions, such as Markovian transitions,  which are violated in these environments.
