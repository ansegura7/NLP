Efficient and Cost-effective Techniques for Browsing and Indexing Large Video Databases We present in this paper a fully automatic content-based approach to organizing and indexing video data. Our methodology involves three steps:  ffl Step 1: We segment each video into shots using a Camera-Tracking technique. This process also extracts the feature vector for each shot, which consists of two statistical variances V ar  BA  and V ar  OA  . These values capture how much things are changing in the background and foreground areas of the video shot.  ffl Step 2: For each video, We apply a fully automatic method to build a browsing hierarchy using the shots identified in Step 1.  ffl Step 3: Using the V ar  BA  and V ar  OA  values obtained in Step 1, we build an index table to support a variance-based video similarity model. That is, video scenes/shots are retrieved based on given values of V ar  BA  and V ar  OA  .  The above three inter-related techniques offer an integrated framework for modeling, browsing, and searching large video databases. Our experimental results indic...
