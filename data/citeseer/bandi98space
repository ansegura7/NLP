Space Discretization for Efficient Human Navigation There is a large body of research on motion control of legs in human models. However, they require specification of global paths in which to move. A method for automatically computing a global motion path for a human in 3D environment of obstacles is presented. Object space is discretized into a 3D grid of uniform cells and an optimal path is generated between two points as a discrete cell path. The grid is treated as graph with orthogonal links of uniform cost. A* search method is applied for path finding. By considering only the cells on the upper surface of objects on which human walks, a large portion of the grid is discarded from the search space, thus boosting efficiency. This is expected to be a higher level mechanism for various local foot placement methods in human animation.  Keywords: global navigation, dynamic programming, A* graph search, articulated body models 1. Introduction  Human walking is a complex and well studied component of articulated body animation research. T...
