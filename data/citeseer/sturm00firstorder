First-order expressivity for S5-models: modal vs. two-sorted languages this paper we are going to prove some results on the expressive power of the standard first-order modal language by comparing it with its extensional counterpart. We thereby restrict our attention to the case where the modal language is interpreted on S5-models. Moreover, we decided to deal exclusively with constant domain models, that is with models in which the domains of all worlds are the same. It is worth mentioning, however, that our method can be applied to logics based on varying domain models as well. Before we describe the results of this paper in more detail, we hasten to add that there exists some work done by other authors to which our results are related. In [8, 9, 10] Fine proves, among other things, a number of preservation results for modal first-order formulas which are relevant for certain philosophical distinctions. For instance, he provides a semantical characterization of de dicto formulas (within S5) and investigates conditions under which de re formulas are eliminable in certain extensions of S5 (see also [6, 18]). In [3] it was shown 2  that a remarkable portion of classical model theory can be transferred to the domain of modal logic. More closely related to our work are [14] and [15]. They discuss a number of formulas from the two-sorted language that are not expressible in the modal language.
