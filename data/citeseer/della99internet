Internet Agents for Telemedicine Services Telemedicine can be viewed as the telematic support for collaboration among distant medical professionals, which cooperate on shared resources of various kind. In light of this, attention to telematics and informatics concepts particularly oriented towards collaboration should be paid: in particular, the recently appeared agent paradigm seems suitable for the analysis, design and development of telemedicine services because of its committment to intercommunication and sharing of resources. The present paper is aimed at introducing the agent paradigm, from the theoretical basis up to the technological issues, and at describing an agent-based approach to telemedicine, specifically applied to telepathology applications. The described system is based on an agent-based tool (JAMES), namely an agent model and template implemented using Java, which has been used to implement a prototype multipurpose telepathology application based on a federated agency architecture.
