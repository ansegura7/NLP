A Neuro-Fuzzy Solution for Integrated Visual and Force Control In this paper the use of a B-spline neuro-fuzzy model for different tasks such as vision-based fine-positioning using uncalibrated cameras and force control is presented. It is shown that neuro-fuzzy controllers can be used not only for low-dimensional problems like force control but also for high-dimensional problems like vision-based sensorimotor control and for fusing input from different sensors. Controllers of this type can be modularly combined to solve a given assembly problem.  1 Introduction  It is well-known that general fuzzy rule descriptions of systems with a large number of input variables suffer from the problem of the "curse of dimensionality." In many realworld applications it is difficult to identify the decisive input parameters and thus to reduce the number of input variables to the minimum. A general solution to building fuzzy models is not only interesting from a theoretical point, it may also extend the range of applications of fuzzy control to more complex intel...
