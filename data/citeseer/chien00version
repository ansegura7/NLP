Version Management of XML Documents The problem of ensuring efficient storage and fast retrieval  for multi-version structured documents is important because of the recent  popularity of XML documents and semistructured information on  the web. Traditional document version control systems, e.g. RCS, which  model documents as a sequence of lines of text and use the shortest edit  script to represent version differences, can be inefficient and they do not  preserve the logical structure of the original document. Therefore, we propose  a new approach where the structure of the documents is preserved  intact, and their sub-objects are timestamped hierarchically for efficient  reconstruction of current and past versions. Our technique, called the  Usefulness Based Copy Control (UBCC), is geared towards efficient version  reconstruction while using small storage overhead. Our analysis and  experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the overall approach to version  control for structured documents. Moreover UBCC can easily support  multiple concurrent versions as well as partial document retrieval.  1
