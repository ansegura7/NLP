A Multiagent Approach for Electronic Travel Planning In the last years, the amount of information stored in Internet has grown exponentially. This article presents a new approach to cooperative problem solving that use the Web as a source of data. The architecture has been designed using two main Artificial Intelligence techniques: Multiagent System design, and problem solving (planning). Both are used to obtain a new architecture that dynamically obtains knowledge from Internet. The system uses two different types of agents: planning agents and web agents. Planning agents pay attention to the user's queries and solve his/her problems at a high level of abstraction; web agents fill in the details obtaining the required information from Internet. Different partial solutions given by the web agents while combined by the planning agent to obtain a detailed solution (or solutions) to the user queries.
