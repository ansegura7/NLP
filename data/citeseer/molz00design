Design of a Classification System for Rectangular Shapes Using a Co-Design Environment Pattern localization and classification are CPU time intensive, being normally implemented in software. Custom implementations in hardware allow real-time processing. In practice, in ASIC or FPGA implementations, the digitization process introduces errors that should be taken into account. This paper presents initially the state-of-the-art in this field, analyzing the performance and implementation of each work. After we propose a system for rectangular shapes localization and classification using reconfigurable devices (FPGA) and a signal processor (DSP) available in a flexible codesign platform. The system will be described using C and VHDL languages, for the software and hardware parts respectively. Finally, it is described the classification block of the system, implemented as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in a rapid prototyping platform.  1.
