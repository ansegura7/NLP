Potter's Wheel: An Interactive Data Cleaning System Cleaning data of errors in structure and content is important  for data warehousing and integration. Current  solutions for data cleaning involve many iterations of  data "auditing" to find errors, and long-running transformations  to fix them. Users need to endure long  waits, and often write complex transformation scripts.  We present Potter's Wheel, an interactive data cleaning  system that tightly integrates transformation and  discrepancy detection. Users gradually build transformations  to clean the data by adding or undoing  transforms on a spreadsheet-like interface; the effect  of a transform is shown at once on records visible on  screen. These transforms are specified either through  simple graphical operations, or by showing the desired  effects on example data values. In the background,  Potter's Wheel automatically infers structures  for data values in terms of user-defined domains, and  accordingly checks for constraint violations. Thus  users can gradually build a transformation as discrepancies  are found, and clean the data without writing  complex programs or enduring long delays.  1
