Efficient Complex Query Support for Multiversion XML Documents Managing multiple versions of XML documents represents a  critical requirement for many applications. Also, there has been much  recent interest in supporting complex queries on XML data (e.g., regular  path expressions, structural projections, DIFF queries). In this paper,  we examine the problem of supporting efficiently complex queries on  multiversioned XML documents. Our approach relies on a scheme based  on durable node numbers (DNNs) that preserve the order among the  XML tree nodes and are invariant with respect to updates. Using the  document's DNNs various complex queries are reduced to combinations  of partial version retrieval queries. We examine three indexing schemes to  efficiently evaluate partial version retrieval queries in this environment. A  thorough performance analysis is then presented to reveal the advantages  of each scheme.
