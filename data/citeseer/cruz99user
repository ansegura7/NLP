A User Interface for Distributed Multimedia Database Querying with Mediator Supported Refinement The Delaunay  MM  system supports an interactive, customizable interface for querying multimedia distributed databases, like Digital Libraries. Through this interface, users select virtual document styles that cater the display of query results to their needs, while also offering transparent pre- and post-query refinement and nested querying. Delaunay  MM  's virtual documents preserve context by maintaining a single customizable interface for result viewing. The advanced transparent query features rely on mediation to provide adept access to information. In this paper, we present the framework for Delaunay  MM  , its architecture, the user interface, and results of the first usability study.  1. INTRODUCTION  With an increase in the number of users daily, the World Wide Web has become an indispensable technology. With increasingly diverse user populations and available technologies, the value of reliable searching and information navigation mechanisms is becoming more significant. The...
