The i.com Tool for Intelligent Conceptual Modelling In this paper we present i.com, a tool for intelligent conceptual modelling. i.com  allows for the specification of multiple EER diagrams and inter- and intra-schema constraints.  Complete logical reasoning is employed by the tool to verify the specification,  infer implicit facts, and manifest any inconsistencies.  1 Introduction  i.com is a tool supporting the conceptual design phase of an information system, and in particular of an integration information system -- such as a data warehouse. The tool is an evolution of part of the conceptual modelling demonstrators suite [Jarke et al., 2000] developed within the European ESPRIT Long Term Research Data Warehouse Quality (DWQ) project [Jarke et al., 1999] . i.com adopts an extended Entity-Relationship (EER) conceptual data model, enriched with multidimensional aggregations and interschema constraints. i.com is fully integrated with a very powerful description logics reasoning server which acts  as a background inference engine.  The co...
