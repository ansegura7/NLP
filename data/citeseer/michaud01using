Using Motives and Artificial Emotion for Long-Term Activity of an Autonomous Robot To operate over a long period of time in the real world, autonomous mobile robots must have the capabilityofrecharging themselves whenever necessary. In addition to be able to nd and dockintoacharging station, robots must be able to decide when and for how long to recharge. This decision is inuenced by the energetic capacity of their batteries and the contingencies of their environments. To deal with this temporality issue and based on researchworks in psychology, this paper investigates the use of motives and articial emotions to regulate the recharging need of autonomous robots. A bipolar model of articial emotion is presented, designed to be generic and not specically congured for a particular task. The paper also describes the use of the approach in two specic applications, the AAAI Mobile Robot Challenge and experiments involving a group of robots share one charging station in an enclosed area.  1.
