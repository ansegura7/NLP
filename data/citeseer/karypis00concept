Concept Indexing - A Fast Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm with Applications to Document Retrieval & Categorization In recent years, we have seen a tremendous growth in the volume of text documents available on the Internet, digital libraries, news sources, and company-wide intranets. This has led to an increased interest in developing meth-ods that can efficiently categorize and retrieve relevant information. Retrieval techniques based on dimensionality reduction, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), have been shown to improve the quality of the information being retrieved by capturing the latent meaning of the words present in the documents. Unfortunately, the high computa-tional requirements of LSI and its inability to compute an effective dimensionality reduction in a supervised setting limits its applicability. In this paper we present a fast dimensionality reduction algorithm, called concept indexing (CI) that is equally effective for unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction. CI computes a k-dimensional representation of a collection of documents by first clustering the documents into k groups, and then using the cen-troid vectors of the clusters to derive the axes of the reduced k-dimensional space. Experimental results show that the dimensionality reduction computed by CI achieves comparable retrieval performance to that obtained using LSI, while requiring an order of magnitude less time. Moreover, when CI is used to compute the dimensionality reduction in a supervised setting, it greatly improves the performance of traditional classification algorithms such as C4.5 and kNN. 1
