Roomware: Towards the next generation of human-computer interaction based on an integrated design of real and virtual worlds In the past, a central mainframe computer provided terminals for many users. In the current age of the personal desktop computer, there is one computer for one person. Observation of early adopters and predictions about the future point to an era where each person will have multiple devices and computational power will be ubiquitous. Against this background, we present a vision for the workspaces of the future and a user-centered approach for an integrated design of virtual information spaces and real architectural spaces. The resulting environments are called cooperative buildings. The design approach is based on the roomware concept. By roomware, we mean computer-augmented objects resulting from the integration of room elements, e.g., walls, doors, furniture (tables, chairs, etc.) with computer-based information devices. They are part of the vision that the world around us will be the interface to information -- where the computer as a device will disappear and people's interaction w...
