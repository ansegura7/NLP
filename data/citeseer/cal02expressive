On the Expressive Power of Data Integration Systems There are basically two approaches for designing a data integration  system. In the global-as-view (GAV) approach, one maps the concepts in the  global schema to views over the sources, whereas in the local-as-view (LAV) approach,  one maps the sources into views over the global schema. The goal of  this paper is to relate the two approaches with respect to their expressive power.
