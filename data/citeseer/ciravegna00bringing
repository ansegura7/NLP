Bringing Information Extraction out of the Labs: the Pinocchio Environment . Pinocchio is an environment for developing Information Extraction applications. New applications and languages can be covered by just writing declarative resources. Information is represented uniformly throughout the architecture: all the modules use the same input structure and the same type of declarative resources. Modules are implemented via the same basic processors and share a common environment for resource development and debugging. The result is an environment easy to use with limited training and skills.  1 INTRODUCTION  The exponential increase in the quantity of information held in digital archives has fueled growing interest in techniques for Information Extraction. Given that the vast majority of available information is textual (e.g., web pages, electronic newspapers, agency news), the role of Information Extraction from text (IE) is becoming more and more central. An IE system extracts pieces of information that are salient to the user's needs. The typical output is a...
