Free hands-on course with the implementation (in Python) and description of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and techniques, on several modern platforms and libraries.

Although it is not intended to have the formal rigor of a book, we tried to be as faithful as possible to the original algorithms and methods, only adding variants, when these were necessary for didactic purposes.

## Quick Start
The best way to get the most out of this course is to carefully read each selected problem, try to think of a possible solution (language independent) and then look at the proposed Python code and try to reproduce it in your favorite IDE. If you already have knowledge of the Python language, then you can go directly to programming your solution and then compare it with the one proposed in the course.

If you want to play with these notebooks online without having to install any library or configure hardware, you can use the following service:

## What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing project with Python frameworks. NLP is a discipline where computer science, artificial intelligence and cognitive logic are intercepted, with the objective that machines can read and understand our language for decision making.
